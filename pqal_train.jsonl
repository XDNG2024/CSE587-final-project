Subsequently, 4 new groups were created, composed of patients with a shunt inserted for the first time (groups 1A and 1B) and patients with a shunt reviewed or inserted for a second time (groups 2A and 2B). Groups 1A and 2A comprised patients in whom an endoscope was used simultaneously with VPS surgery, and groups 1B and 2B comprised patients in whom an endoscope was not used. These groups were compared to determine the infection rate."}
{"Research Question":"Is there any relationship between streptococcal infection and multiple sclerosis?","Introduction":"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated inflammatory demyelinating disease of uncertain etiology. Although the mechanisms of inducting autoimmunity by some of the infectious agents have been investigated, there is not yet enough research on streptococcal infections.MATERIAL\/","Methodology":"To understand the effect of past group A streptococcal infection on MS, antistreptolysin O (ASO) and antideoxyribonuclease B (ADNase B) were measured in 21 patients with relapsing-remitting MS and 21 healthy blood donors by nephelometric assay."}
{"Research Question":"Assessing joint line positions by means of the contralateral knee: a new approach for planning knee revision surgery?","Introduction":"Reconstructing the natural joint line in knee revision surgery improves clinical and functional outcome but may be challenging when both cartilage and bone were removed during previous operations. Assessing joint lines (JLs) by means of bony landmarks is inadvisable because of large variations in human anatomy. Because of the inherent symmetry of the human body, we hypothesised that JLs may be directly assessed by measuring the distances from the bony landmarks to the JL of the contralateral knee by means of radiographic images.","Methodology":"Using scaled weight-bearing radiographs in anteroposterior view of both knees, two independent observers measured the distances from the fibular head, the medial and lateral epicondyle, and the adductor tubercle to the JL. A two-sided p value of ≤0.05 was considered statistically significant."}
{"Research Question":"Continuation of pregnancy after antenatal corticosteroid administration: opportunity for rescue?","Introduction":"To determine the duration of continuing pregnancy after antenatal corticosteroid (AC) administration and to evaluate the potential opportunity for rescue AC.","Methodology":"Retrospective analysis of women at 24-32 weeks' gestation who received AC at one institution."}
{"Research Question":"Does either obesity or OSA severity influence the response of autotitrating CPAP machines in very obese subjects?","Introduction":"The pressures delivered by autotitrating continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) devices not only treat obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) effectively but also give potentially interesting physiological information about the forces impinging on the pharynx. In earlier work from this unit, we used correlations between autoCPAP pressure and both OSA severity and obesity, to construct an algorithm to estimate the fixed CPAP pressure a patient required for subsequent clinical use. We wished to discover if these relationships could be reliably extended to a much more obese group.","Methodology":"We performed a prospective cohort study in an obese population. Measurements of obesity were made, OSA severity was recorded, and the 95th centile autoCPAP pressure was recorded during 1 week of autoCPAP. Spearman's rank correlation was performed between measurements of obesity and autoCPAP pressure, and between OSA severity and autoCPAP pressure."}
{"Research Question":"Is the Distance Worth It?","Introduction":"The purpose of this study was to determine whether operative volume outweighs the advantages of being treated locally by comparing the outcomes of patients with rectal cancer treated at local, low-volume centers versus far, high-volume centers.\nIt is unclear whether traveling long distances to high-volume centers would compensate for travel burden among patients undergoing rectal cancer resection.","Methodology":"This was a population-based study."}
{"Research Question":"Immune suppression by lysosomotropic amines and cyclosporine on T-cell responses to minor and major histocompatibility antigens: does synergy exist?","Introduction":"Using murine models, we have shown that the lysosomotropic amine, chloroquine, is effective in the prevention of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) mediated by donor T cells reactive with recipient minor histocompatibility antigens (MiHCs). Because lysosomotropic amines can suppress major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigen presentation, their mechanism of action is potentially different from current immune suppressant drugs used to control GVHD such as cyclosporine.","Methodology":"We investigated the use of cyclosporine and the lysosomotropic amines chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in combination for additive or synergistic immunosuppression on T-cell responses in vitro to MiHC and MHC in mice."}
{"Research Question":"Does induction chemotherapy have a role in the management of nasopharyngeal carcinoma?","Introduction":"To assess the outcomes of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) whose treatment was determined by computerized tomography (CT) and\/or magnetic resonance imaging staging and to analyze the impact of induction chemotherapy and accelerated fractionated radiotherapy.","Methodology":"The analysis is based on 122 of 143 previously untreated patients with NPC treated with radiation therapy at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center between 1983 and 1992. Excluded were 4 patients treated with palliative intent, 4 children, 12 patients not staged with CT, and 1 patient who died of a cerebrovascular accident prior to completion of treatment. The stage distribution was as follows: AJCC Stage I-2, Stage II-7, Stage III-12, Stage IV-101; Tl-15, T2-33, T3-22, T4-52; N0-32, N1-10, N2-47, N3-32, Nx-1. Fifty-nine (48%) patients had squamous cell carcinoma; 63 (52%) had lymphoepitheliomas, undifferentiated NPC or poorly differentiated carcinoma, NOS (UNPC). Sixty-seven patients (65 with Stage IV disease) received induction chemotherapy. Fifty-eight patients (24 of whom had induction chemotherapy) were treated with the concomitant boost fractionation schedule. The median follow-up for surviving patients was 57 months."}
{"Research Question":"Treatment of contralateral hydrocele in neonatal testicular torsion: Is less more?","Introduction":"Treatment of neonatal testicular torsion has two objectives: salvage of the involved testicle (which is rarely achieved) and preservation of the contralateral gonad. The second goal universally involves contralateral testicular scrotal fixation to prevent the future occurrence of contralateral torsion. However, there is controversy with regards to management of a synchronous contralateral hydrocele. It has been our policy not to address the contralateral hydrocele through an inguinal incision to minimize potential injury to the spermatic cord. Our objective in this study was to determine whether the decision to manage a contralateral hydrocele in cases of neonatal testicular torsion solely through a scrotal approach is safe and effective.","Methodology":"We reviewed all cases of neonatal testicular torsion occurring at our institution between the years 1999 and 2006. Age at presentation, physical examination, ultrasonographic and intraoperative findings were recorded. Patients were followed after initial surgical intervention to determine the likelihood of developing a subsequent hydrocele or hernia."}
{"Research Question":"Detailed analysis of sputum and systemic inflammation in asthma phenotypes: are paucigranulocytic asthmatics really non-inflammatory?","Introduction":"The technique of induced sputum has allowed to subdivide asthma patients into inflammatory phenotypes according to their level of granulocyte airway infiltration. There are very few studies which looked at detailed sputum and blood cell counts in a large cohort of asthmatics divided into inflammatory phenotypes. The purpose of this study was to analyze sputum cell counts, blood leukocytes and systemic inflammatory markers in these phenotypes, and investigate how those groups compared with healthy subjects.","Methodology":"We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study on 833 asthmatics recruited from the University Asthma Clinic of Liege and compared them with 194 healthy subjects. Asthmatics were classified into inflammatory phenotypes."}
{"Research Question":"Is HIV\/STD control in Jamaica making a difference?","Introduction":"To assess the impact of the comprehensive HIV\/STD Control Program established in Jamaica since the late 1980s on the HIV\/AIDS epidemic.","Methodology":"AIDS case reports, HIV testing of blood donors, antenatal clinic attenders (ANC), food service workers, sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic attenders, female prostitutes, homosexuals and other groups were used to monitor the HIV\/AIDS epidemic. Primary and secondary syphilis and cases of congenital syphilis were also monitored. National knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) surveys were conducted in 1988, 1989, 1992, 1994 and 1996."}
{"Research Question":"Is Panton-Valentine leucocidin associated with the pathogenesis of Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia in the UK?","Introduction":"The morbidity and mortality associated with Panton-Valentine leucocidin (PVL)-positive Staphylococcus aureus suggest that this toxin is a key marker of disease severity. Nevertheless, the importance of PVL in the pathogenesis of primary bacteraemia caused by S. aureus is uncertain. We have determined the prevalence of PVL-encoding genes among isolates of S. aureus from bacteraemic patients.","Methodology":"Consecutive bacteraemia isolates of S. aureus (n=244) from patients hospitalized in 25 centres in the UK and Ireland during 2005 were screened for PVL and mecA genes. PVL-positive isolates were characterized by toxin gene profiling, PFGE, spa-typing and MIC determinations for a range of antimicrobials."}
{"Research Question":"Does positron emission tomography change management in primary rectal cancer?","Introduction":"The influence of positron emission tomography in the management of recurrent rectal cancer is well established but its role in primary rectal cancer remains uncertain. This study therefore prospectively assesses the impact of position emission tomography scanning on the management of primary rectal cancer.","Methodology":"Forty-six patients with advanced primary rectal cancer referred for consideration of adjuvant preoperative therapy underwent position emission tomography scanning. The referring physicians prospectively recorded each patient's stage following conventional imaging and the proposed treatment plan prior to position emission tomography scanning. This was then compared with subsequent stage and actual management implemented, and the appropriateness of position emission tomography-induced changes was noted by subsequent clinical follow-up."}
{"Research Question":"Can increases in the cigarette tax rate be linked to cigarette retail prices?","Introduction":"To explain China's cigarette pricing mechanism and the role of the Chinese State Tobacco Monopoly Administration (STMA) on cigarette pricing and taxation.","Methodology":"Published government tobacco tax documentation and statistics published by the Chinese STMA are used to analyse the interrelations among industry profits, taxes and retail price of cigarettes in China."}
{"Research Question":"Does hypoglycaemia increase the risk of cardiovascular events?","Introduction":"Hypoglycaemia caused by glucose-lowering therapy has been linked to cardiovascular (CV) events. The ORIGIN trial provides an opportunity to further assess this relationship.","Methodology":"A total of 12 537 participants with dysglycaemia and high CV-risk were randomized to basal insulin glargine titrated to a fasting glucose of ≤ 5.3 mmol\/L (95 mg\/dL) or standard glycaemic care. Non-severe hypoglycaemia was defined as symptoms confirmed by glucose ≤ 54 mg\/dL and severe hypoglycaemia as a requirement for assistance or glucose ≤ 36 mg\/dL. Outcomes were: (i) the composite of CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or stroke; (ii) mortality; (iii) CV mortality; and (iv) arrhythmic death. Hazards were estimated before and after adjustment for a hypoglycaemia propensity score. During a median of 6.2 years (IQR: 5.8-6.7), non-severe hypoglycaemic episodes occurred in 41.7 and 14.4% glargine and standard group participants, respectively, while severe episodes occurred in 5.7 and 1.8%, respectively. Non-severe hypoglycaemia was not associated with any outcome following adjustment. Conversely, severe hypoglycaemia was associated with a greater risk for the primary outcome (HR: 1.58; 95% CI: 1.24-2.02, P<0.001), mortality (HR: 1.74; 95% CI: 1.39-2.19, P<0.001), CV death (HR: 1.71; 95% CI: 1.27-2.30, P<0.001) and arrhythmic death (HR: 1.77; 95% CI: 1.17-2.67, P = 0.007). Similar findings were noted for severe nocturnal hypoglycaemia for the primary outcome and mortality. The severe hypoglycaemia hazard for all four outcomes was higher with standard care than with insulin glargine."}
{"Research Question":"Does the radiographic transition zone correlate with the level of aganglionosis on the specimen in Hirschsprung's disease?","Introduction":"The correlation between radiographic transition zone on contrast enema in Hirschsprung's disease and the total length of aganglionosis is known to be inaccurate. The aim of our study was to analyse this correlation more precisely to improve preoperative planning of the corrective surgery.","Methodology":"From 1998 to 2009, 79 patients were operated on for Hirschsprung's disease. All available preoperative contrast enemas (n = 61) had been single blind reviewed by the same radiologist who defined the radiographic transition zone when present in vertebral level. Four groups were determined (rectal, rectosigmoid, long segment, and absence of transition zone) and by Kappa coefficient of agreement correlated to the length of aganglionosis in the pathological report."}
{"Research Question":"Is dexamethasone an effective alternative to oral prednisone in the treatment of pediatric asthma exacerbations?","Introduction":"A short course of systemic corticosteroids is an important therapy in the treatment of pediatric asthma exacerbations. Although a 5-day course of oral prednisone or prednisolone has become the most commonly used regimen, dexamethasone has also been used for a shorter duration (1-2 days) with potential for improvement in compliance and palatability. We reviewed the literature to determine if there is sufficient evidence that dexamethasone can be used as an effective alternative in the treatment of pediatric asthma exacerbations in the inpatient setting.","Methodology":"A Medline search was conducted on the use of dexamethasone in the treatment of asthma exacerbations in children. The studies selected were clinical trials comparing the efficacy of dexamethasone with prednisone. Meta-analysis was performed examining physician revisitation rates and symptomatic return to baseline."}

Data in the form of interviews transcriptions was subjected to qualitative content analysis."}
{"Research Question":"Does the lipid-lowering peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors ligand bezafibrate prevent colon cancer in patients with coronary artery disease?","Introduction":"Epidemiologic studies have suggested that hypertriglyceridemia and insulin resistance are related to the development of colon cancer. Nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR), which play a central role in lipid and glucose metabolism, had been hypothesized as being involved in colon cancerogenesis. In animal studies the lipid-lowering PPAR ligand bezafibrate suppressed colonic tumors. However, the effect of bezafibrate on colon cancer development in humans is unknown. Therefore, we proposed to investigate a possible preventive effect of bezafibrate on the development of colon cancer in patients with coronary artery disease during a 6-year follow-up.","Methodology":"Our population included 3011 patients without any cancer diagnosis who were enrolled in the randomized, double blind Bezafibrate Infarction Prevention (BIP) Study. The patients received either 400 mg of bezafibrate retard (1506 patients) or placebo (1505 patients) once a day. Cancer incidence data were obtained by matching a subject's identification numbers with the National Cancer Registry. Each matched record was checked for correct identification."}
{"Research Question":"Does self-efficacy mediate the relationship between transformational leadership behaviours and healthcare workers' sleep quality?","Introduction":"Although there is evidence for the influential role of transformational leadership on health outcomes, researchers have used either attitude outcomes (e.g. job satisfaction) or softer health measures, such as general well-being. Specific measures of well-being such as sleep quality have not been used, despite its association with working conditions.","Methodology":"A longitudinal design was used to collect data from Danish healthcare workers at time 1 in 2005 (n = 447) and 18 months later at time 2 in 2007 (n = 274). Structural equation modelling was used to investigate the relationships between transformational leadership, self-efficacy and sleep quality at both time points independently (cross-sectionally) and longitudinally."}
{"Research Question":"Does microbial contamination influence the success of the hematopoietic cell transplantation outcomes?","Introduction":"Microbial contamination can be a marker for faulty process and is assumed to play an important role in the collection of hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) and infusion procedure. We aimed to determine the microbial contamination rates and evaluate the success of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in patients who received contaminated products.PATIENTS-","Methodology":"We analyzed microbial contamination records of HPC grafts between 2012 and 2015, retrospectively.

It was dosed the pre-operative (initial) and post-surgical (end) serum blood glucose, in addition to quantify the gastric content after the resection of the part."}
{"Research Question":"Are physicians aware of the side effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors?","Introduction":"Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) are considered safe, but they are associated with characteristic side effects, namely cough and angioedema, usually requiring discontinuation. We perceived that referrals for these side effects have become more and more frequent; therefore, we evaluated the degree of knowledge on the safety of ACE-I in different medical categories.","Methodology":"A questionnaire (13 questions) on side effects of ACE-I was posted to physicians."}
{"Research Question":"Residual fundus or neofundus after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy: is fundectomy safe and effective as revision surgery?","Introduction":"Up to 30 % of patients who have undergone laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy require revision surgery for inadequate weight loss, weight regain, and\/or the development of severe upper gastrointestinal symptoms. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of laparoscopic fundectomy (LF) in cases of a residual fundus\/neofundus development regarding GERD symptoms.","Methodology":"The study group comprised 19 patients (17 female; mean BMI 35.4 kg\/m(2)) divided into 2 groups. Group A (n = 10) patients with severe GERD and evidence of residual fundus\/neofundus, Hiatal hernia with good results in terms of weight loss. Group B (n = 9) patients with severe GERD, a residual fundus\/neofundus, inadequate weight loss or weight regain. Fundectomy was indicated when a residual fundus\/neofundus was associated with severe GERD symptoms. The presence of a residual fundus\/neofundus was assessed by a barium swallow and\/or multislice computed tomography."}
{"Research Question":"Are physician estimates of asthma severity less accurate in black than in white patients?","Introduction":"We hypothesized that: 1) physician underestimation of asthma severity is more frequent among black patients; 2) among black patients, physician underestimation of severity is associated with poorer quality asthma care.\nRacial differences in asthma care are not fully explained by socioeconomic status, care access, and insurance status. Appropriate care requires accurate physician estimates of severity. It is unknown if accuracy of physician estimates differs between black and white patients, and how this relates to asthma care disparities.","Methodology":"We conducted a cross-sectional survey among adult patients with asthma cared for in 15 managed care organizations in the United States. We collected physicians' estimates of their patients' asthma severity. Physicians' estimates of patients' asthma as being less severe than patient-reported symptoms were classified as underestimates of severity."}
{"Research Question":"Does laparoscopic surgery decrease the risk of atrial fibrillation after foregut surgery?","Introduction":"Atrial fibrillation, which occurs in 12% of all major foregut surgeries, can prolong hospital stay and increase morbidity. Minimally invasive techniques in foregut surgery have been suggested to cause less tissue trauma. We examined the factors associated with new-onset atrial fibrillation after foregut surgery at our institution.","Methodology":"We retrospectively examined the records of 154 adult patients who underwent major foregut surgery which included esophagectomy, partial or total gastrectomy, redo Heller myotomy, redo or transthoracic fundoplications. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis with standard modeling techniques were performed to determine risk factors for new-onset atrial fibrillation."}
{"Research Question":"The Main Gate Syndrome: a new format in mass-casualty victim \"surge\" management?","Introduction":"Recent suicide bombings pose the novel problem for Trauma Centers of the massive simultaneous arrival of many gravely wounded patients.","Methodology":"We report the experience of the French-German Military Trauma Group, a Level 2 Trauma Center, in Afghanistan during the wave of suicide bombings in February 2007."}
{"Research Question":"Do communication disorders extend to musical messages?","Introduction":"This study compared recognition of symbolic representation of emotions or movements in music by two groups of children with different communicative characteristics: severe to profound hearing loss (using cochlear implants [CI]) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Their responses were compared to those of children with typical-development and normal hearing (TD-NH). Accuracy was examined as a function of communicative status, emotional or movement category, and individual characteristics.\nEffective musical communication requires conveyance of the intended message in a manner perceptible to the receiver. Communication disorders that impair transmitting or decoding of structural features of music (e.g., pitch, timbre) and\/or symbolic representation may result in atypical musical communication, which can have a negative impact on music therapy interventions.","Methodology":"Participants listened to recorded musical excerpts conveying emotions or movements and matched them with labels. Measures relevant to auditory and\/or language function were also gathered."}
{"Research Question":"Do patients with rheumatoid arthritis established on methotrexate and folic acid 5 mg daily need to continue folic acid supplements long term?","Introduction":"To look at the effect of stopping FA supplementation in UK rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients established on methotrexate<20 mg weekly and FA 5 mg daily, to report all toxicity (including absolute changes in haematological and liver enzyme indices) and to report changes in the efficacy of methotrexate.\nIt is postulated that some aspects of methotrexate toxicity may be related to its action as an anti-folate. Folic acid (FA) is often given as an adjunct to methotrexate therapy, but there is no conclusive proof that it decreases the toxicity of methotrexate and there is a theoretical risk that it may decrease the efficacy of methotrexate.","Methodology":"In a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 75 patients who were established on methotrexate<20 mg weekly and FA 5 mg daily were asked to stop their FA and were randomized to one of two groups: placebo or FA 5 mg daily. Patients were evaluated for treatment toxicity and efficacy before entry and then at intervals of 3 months for 1 yr."}
{"Research Question":"Is duration of psychological treatment for depression related to return into treatment?","Introduction":"There is increasing pressure on mental health providers to reduce the duration of treatments, while retaining level of quality and effectiveness. The risk is that the population is underserved and therefore needs new treatment episodes. The primary aim of this study was to investigate whether duration of treatment and return into mental health care were related.","Methodology":"This study examined Dutch patients with an initial treatment episode in 2009 or 2010 in specialized mental health settings for depressive disorder (N = 85,754). Follow-up data about treatment episodes were available up until 2013. The data set included demographic (age, gender), and clinical factors (comorbidity with other DSM-IV Axis; scores on the 'Global Assessment of Functioning'). Cox regression analyses were used to assess whether duration of treatment and relapse into mental health care were related."}
{"Research Question":"Does shaving the incision site increase the infection rate after spinal surgery?","Introduction":"To determine whether shaving the incision site before spinal surgery causes postsurgical infection.\nSpine surgeons usually shave the skin of the incision site immediately before surgery is performed. However, evidence from some surgical series suggests that presurgical shaving may increase the postsurgical infection rate. To our knowledge, no previously published studies have addressed this issue.","Methodology":"A prospective randomized clinical study. A total of 789 patients scheduled to undergo spinal surgery were randomly allocated into 2 groups: those in whom the site of operation was shaved immediately before surgery (shaved group; 371 patients) and the patients in whom presurgical shaving was not performed (unshaved group; 418 patients). The mean duration of anesthesia and the infection rates in both groups were recorded and compared."}
{"Research Question":"The influence of atmospheric pressure on aortic aneurysm rupture--is the diameter of the aneurysm important?","Introduction":"The rate of aortic aneurysm rupture correlates with the aneurysm's diameter, and a higher rate of rupture is observed in patients with larger aneurysms. According to the literature, contradictory results concerning the relationship between atmospheric pressure and aneurysm size have been reported.AIM: In this paper, we assessed the influence of changes in atmospheric pressure on abdominal aneurysm ruptures in relationship to the aneurysm's size.","Methodology":"The records of 223 patients with ruptured abdominal aneurysms were evaluated. All of the patients had been admitted to the department in the period 1997-2007 from the Silesia region. The atmospheric pressures on the day of the rupture and on the days both before the rupture and between the rupture events were compared. The size of the aneurysm was also considered in the analysis."}
{"Research Question":"Do French lay people and health professionals find it acceptable to breach confidentiality to protect a patient's wife from a sexually transmitted disease?","Introduction":"To determine under what conditions lay people and health professionals find it acceptable for a physician to breach confidentiality to protect the wife of a patient with a sexually transmitted disease (STD).","Methodology":"In a study in France, breaching confidentiality in 48 scenarios were accepted by 144 lay people, 10 psychologists and 7 physicians. The scenarios were all possible combinations of five factors: severity of the disease (severe, lethal); time taken to discuss this with (little time, much time); intent to inform the spouse about the disease (none, one of these days, immediately); intent to adopt protective behaviours (no intent, intent); and decision to consult an expert in STDs (yes, no), 2 x 2 x 3 x 2 x 2. The importance and interactions of each factor were determined, at the group level, by performing analyses of variance and constructing graphs."}
{"Research Question":"Do somatic complaints predict subsequent symptoms of depression?","Introduction":"Evidence suggests substantial comorbidity between symptoms of somatization and depression in clinical as well as nonclinical populations. However, as most existing research has been retrospective or cross-sectional in design, very little is known about the specific nature of this relationship. In particular, it is unclear whether somatic complaints may heighten the risk for the subsequent development of depressive symptoms.","Methodology":"We report findings on the link between symptoms of somatization (assessed using the SCL-90-R) and depression 5 years later (assessed using the CES-D) in an initially healthy cohort of community adults, based on prospective data from the RENO Diet-Heart Study."}
{"Research Question":"Are women with major depression in pregnancy identifiable in population health data?","Introduction":"Although record linkage of routinely collected health datasets is a valuable research resource, most datasets are established for administrative purposes and not for health outcomes research. In order for meaningful results to be extrapolated to specific populations, the limitations of the data and linkage methodology need to be investigated and clarified. It is the objective of this study to investigate the differences in ascertainment which may arise between a hospital admission dataset and a dispensing claims dataset, using major depression in pregnancy as an example. The safe use of antidepressants in pregnancy is an ongoing issue for clinicians with around 10% of pregnant women suffer from depression. As the birth admission will be the first admission to hospital during their pregnancy for most women, their use of antidepressants, or their depressive condition, may not be revealed to the attending hospital clinicians. This may result in adverse outcomes for the mother and infant.","Methodology":"Population-based de-identified data were provided from the Western Australian Data Linkage System linking the administrative health records of women with a delivery to related records from the Midwives' Notification System, the Hospital Morbidity Data System and the national Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme dataset. The women with depression during their pregnancy were ascertained in two ways: women with dispensing records relating to dispensed antidepressant medicines with an WHO ATC code to the 3rd level, pharmacological subgroup, 'N06A Antidepressants'; and, women with any hospital admission during pregnancy, including the birth admission, if a comorbidity was recorded relating to depression."}
{"Research Question":"Remote ischemic postconditioning: does it protect against ischemic damage in percutaneous coronary revascularization?","Introduction":"Myocardial damage that is associated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) partially affects the results of the procedure, and is related to medium-term cardiovascular death. Remote postischemic conditioning might reduce the myocardial lesions that are associated with PCI, but perhaps less so in diabetics. The aim of this study was to evaluate the protective effect of remote postischemic conditioning in patients undergoing elective PCI for stable angina or non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome with troponin<1 ng\/ml at the time of randomization.","Methodology":"This randomized single-blinded single-center clinical trial involved 320 patients undergoing elective PCI who were randomized to either receive three 5-min cycles of ischemia by inflation of a cuff on the non-dominant arm to 200 mm Hg (remote postischemic conditioning) or to placebo (uninflated cuff).

{"Research Question":"Can transcranial direct current stimulation be useful in differentiating unresponsive wakefulness syndrome from minimally conscious state patients?","Introduction":"Disorders of consciousness (DOC) diagnosis relies on the presence or absence of purposeful motor responsiveness, which characterizes the minimally conscious state (MCS) and the unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS), respectively. Functional neuroimaging studies have raised the question of possible residual conscious awareness also in clinically-defined UWS patients. The aim of our study was to identify electrophysiological parameters, by means of a transcranial magnetic stimulation approach, which might potentially express the presence of residual networks sustaining fragmentary behavioral patterns, even when no conscious behavior can be observed.","Methodology":"We enrolled 25 severe DOC patients, following post-anoxic or traumatic brain injury and 20 healthy individuals (HC) as control group. Baseline electrophysiological evaluation evidenced, in comparison to HC, a partial preservation of cortical effective connectivity and excitability in clinically defined MCS, whereas these components were absent in clinically defined UWS. Then, we applied an anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (a-tDCS) protocol over the orbitofrontal cortex."}

Gradients were estimated by fitting generalised linear models to the quintile-specific life expectancy estimates for each ethnic group (by sex). The contribution of variation in deprivation distributions to inter-ethnic inequalities in life expectancy was estimated by re-weighting the quintile-specific mortality rates for each ethnic group using weights derived from the European deprivation distribution and recalculating the lifetable."}
{"Research Question":"Can normal knee kinematics be restored with unicompartmental knee replacement?","Introduction":"Unicompartmental replacement can be an alternative to tibial osteotomy in younger, active patients with unicompartmental knee disease. In unicompartmental replacement, the other compartments and knee ligaments are largely untouched. Therefore, it was hypothesized that the knee kinematics after unicompartmental replacement may also be unchanged. To test this hypothesis, knee kinematics and quadriceps tension were recorded before and after replacement with a unicompartmental design and then with a tricompartmental design.","Methodology":"Six human cadaver knees were tested before implantation, after implantation with a bicruciate-retaining unicompartmental knee prosthesis, and after implantation with a posterior cruciate-retaining tricompartmental knee prosthesis. The unicompartmental prosthesis was initially implanted, and it was then revised to a total condylar knee replacement. The knee kinematics were measured with use of an electromagnetic tracking device while the knee was put through dynamic simulated stair-climbing under peak flexion moments of approximately 40 N-m. Quadriceps tension was also measured for all three conditions."}

{"Research Question":"The Deformity Angular Ratio: Does It Correlate With High-Risk Cases for Potential Spinal Cord Monitoring Alerts in Pediatric 3-Column Thoracic Spinal Deformity Corrective Surgery?","Introduction":"The purpose of this study was to determine whether the deformity angular ratio (DAR) can reliably assess the neurological risks of patients undergoing deformity correction.\nIdentifying high-risk patients and procedures can help ensure that appropriate measures are taken to minimize neurological complications during spinal deformity corrections. Subjectively, surgeons look at radiographs and evaluate the riskiness of the procedure. However, 2 curves of similar magnitude and location can have significantly different risks of neurological deficit during surgery. Whether the curve spans many levels or just a few can significantly influence surgical strategies. Lenke et al have proposed the DAR, which is a measure of curve magnitude per level of deformity.","Methodology":"A retrospective analysis. The data from 35 pediatric spinal deformity correction procedures with thoracic 3-column osteotomies were reviewed. Measurements from preoperative radiographs were used to calculate the DAR. Binary logistic regression was used to model the relationship between DARs (independent variables) and presence or absence of an intraoperative alert (dependent variable)."}

{"Research Question":"Autoxidation products of both carbohydrates and lipids are increased in uremic plasma: is there oxidative stress in uremia?","Introduction":"Advanced glycation end products (AGEs), formed by non-enzymatic glycation and oxidation (glycoxidation) reactions, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several diseases, including normoglycemic uremia. AGE research in uremia has focused on the accumulation of carbohydrate-derived adducts generated by the Maillard reaction. Recent studies, however, have demonstrated that one AGE, the glycoxidation product carboxymethyllysine (CML), could be derived not only from carbohydrates but also from oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids in vitro, raising the possibility that both carbohydrate and lipid autoxidation might be increased in uremia.","Methodology":"To address this hypothesis, we applied gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and high performance liquid chromatography to measure protein adducts formed in uremic plasma by reactions between carbonyl compounds and protein amino groups: pentosidine derived from carbohydrate-derived carbonyls, malondialdehyde (MDA)-lysine derived from lipid-derived carbonyls, and CML originating possibly from both sources."}

{"Research Question":"Are the arginine vasopressin V1a receptor microsatellites related to hypersexuality in children with a prepubertal and early adolescent bipolar disorder phenotype?","Introduction":"To examine family-based transmission of the number of 5' flanking arginine vasopressin V1a receptor (AVPR1A) microsatellites, which include [(GATA)(14)] and complex [(CT)(4)-TT-(CT)(8)-(GT)(24)]repeats, in probands with a prepubertal and early adolescent bipolar disorder phenotype (PEA-BP). Preferential transmission of the number of AVPR1A microsatellite repeats to hypersexual and uninhibited people-seeking probands was hypothesized, based on reports from preclinical work in the literature.","Methodology":"Probands were 83 participants in an ongoing controlled study of PEA-BP. The PEA-BP phenotype was defined by DSM-IV mania with at least one of the cardinal symptoms of mania (elation and\/or grandiosity) to avoid diagnosing mania only by symptoms that overlapped with those for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Comprehensive assessment of the probands included separate Washington University in St. Louis Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (WASH-U-KSADS) interviews of parents about their children and of children about themselves. Hypersexuality and uninhibited people-seeking were assessed from the corresponding WASH-U-KSADS items. Microsatellite genotyping of the AVPR1A repeats was conducted using fluorescently labeled primers and detected by laser-induced fluorescence. Alleles were determined with the assistance of semi-automated allele-calling software. There were 32 complete, biological trios (28 informative families) for the GATA repeat and 34 complete, biological trios (30 informative families) for the complex repeat. Data were analyzed using case-control and family-based association methods."}

{"Research Question":"Literacy after cerebral hemispherectomy: Can the isolated right hemisphere read?","Introduction":"Cerebral hemispherectomy, a surgical procedure undergone to control intractable seizures, is becoming a standard procedure with more cases identified and treated early in life [33]. While the effect of the dominant hemisphere resection on spoken language has been extensively researched, little is known about reading abilities in individuals after left-sided resection. Left-lateralized phonological abilities are the key components of reading, i.e., grapheme-phoneme conversion skills [1]. These skills are critical for the acquisition of word-specific orthographic knowledge and have been shown to predict reading levels in average readers as well as in readers with mild cognitive disability [26]. Furthermore, impaired phonological processing has been implicated as the cognitive basis in struggling readers. Here, we explored the reading skills in participants who have undergone left cerebral hemispherectomy.","Methodology":"Seven individuals who have undergone left cerebral hemispherectomy to control intractable seizures associated with perinatal infarct have been recruited for this study. We examined if components of phonological processing that are shown to reliably separate average readers from struggling readers, i.e., phonological awareness, verbal memory, speed of retrieval, and size of vocabulary, show the same relationship to reading levels when they are mediated by the right hemisphere [2]."}

{"Research Question":"Juvenile osteochondritis dissecans: is it a growth disturbance of the secondary physis of the epiphysis?","Introduction":"The primary physis is responsible for longitudinal bone growth. Similarly, epiphysial growth relies on endochondral ossification from the circumferential secondary physeal [corrected]. injury can result in disruption of normal ossification. The cause of juvenile osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) remains elusive. We hypothesized that juvenile OCD results from an insult affecting endochondral ossification from the secondary physis. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the MRI appearance of the distal femoral epiphysis-particularly the secondary physis-of children with juvenile OCD and to compare these findings with the MRI findings of unaffected children.","Methodology":"Knee MRI examinations of 30 children (age range, 8 years 8 months to 13 years 4 months) with OCD and 30 matched control patients were evaluated for skeletal maturity; location of the OCD lesion, if present; secondary physeal [corrected] continuity; overlying chondroepiphysial integrity, contour, and width; signal intensity of subchondral bone; and secondary physeal [corrected]conspicuity. Variables were compared using chi-square tests."}
{"Research Question":"Can we rely on arterial line sampling in performing activated plasma thromboplastin time after cardiac surgery?","Introduction":"Arterial catheters are routinely used to sample blood for clotting studies in most cardiothoracic intensive care units. The clotting profile in surgical bleeding after cardiac surgery influences further management. Aspiration and discard of a certain amount of blood from the line, prior to sampling, are assumed to clear heparin contamination. We have investigated this assumption through analysis of the clotting profile by simultaneous arterial line and peripheral venous samples.","Methodology":"The morning following cardiac surgery, simultaneous arterial line and peripheral venous blood samples were taken for activated plasma thromboplastin time (APTT) ratio and international normalized ratio (INR) in 49 randomly selected patients. Also, a thromboelastogram analysis (TEG) (n = 7) was made.

{"Research Question":"Does quantitative left ventricular regional wall motion change after fibrous tissue resection in endomyocardial fibrosis?","Introduction":"We compared left ventricular regional wall motion, the global left ventricular ejection fraction, and the New York Heart Association functional class pre- and postoperatively.\nEndomyocardial fibrosis is characterized by fibrous tissue deposition in the endomyocardium of the apex and\/or inflow tract of one or both ventricles. Although left ventricular global systolic function is preserved, patients exhibit wall motion abnormalities in the apical and inferoapical regions. Fibrous tissue resection in New York Heart Association FC III and IV endomyocardial fibrosis patients has been shown to decrease morbidity and mortality.","Methodology":"We prospectively studied 30 patients (20 female, 30+\/-10 years) before and 5+\/-8 months after surgery. The left ventricular ejection fraction was determined using the area-length method. Regional left ventricular motion was measured by the centerline method. Five left ventricular segments were analyzed pre- and postoperatively. Abnormality was expressed in units of standard deviation from the mean motion in a normal reference population."}
{"Research Question":"Bridge experience with long-term implantable left ventricular assist devices. Are they an alternative to transplantation?","Introduction":"If long-term use of left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) as bridges to transplantation is successful, the issue of permanent device implantation in lieu of transplantation could be addressed through the creation of appropriately designed trials. Our medium-term experience with both pneumatically and electrically powered ThermoCardiosystems LVADs is presented to outline the benefits and limitations of device support in lieu of transplantation.","Methodology":"Detailed records were kept prospectively for all patients undergoing LVAD insertion. Fifty-eight LVADs were inserted over 5 years, with a survival rate of 74%. Mean patient age was 50 years, and duration of support averaged 98 days. Although common, both preexisting infection and infection during LVAD support were not associated with increased mortality or decreased rate of successful transplantation. Thromboembolic complications were rare, occurring in only three patients (5%) despite the absence of anticoagulation. Ventricular arrhythmias were well tolerated in all patients except in cases of early perioperative right ventricular failure, with no deaths. Right ventricular failure occurred in one third of patients and was managed in a small percentage by right ventricular assist device (RVAD) support and\/or inhaled nitric oxide therapy. There were no serious device malfunctions, but five graft-related hemorrhages resulted in two deaths. Finally, a variety of noncardiac surgical procedures were performed in LVAD recipients, with no major morbidity and mortality."}

{"Research Question":"Preservation of the PCL when performing cruciate-retaining TKA: Is the tibial tuberosity a reliable predictor of the PCL footprint location?","Introduction":"Reconstruction of the joint line is crucial in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). A routine height of tibial cut to maintain the natural joint line may compromise the preservation of the PCL. Since the PCL footprint is not accessible prior to tibial osteotomy, it seems beneficial to identify a reliable extraarticular anatomic landmark for predicting the PCL footprint and being visible within standard TKA approach. The fibula head predicts reliably the location of PCL footprint; however, it is not accessible during TKA. The aim of this study now was to analyze whether the tibial tuberosity can serve as a reliable referencing landmark to estimate the PCL footprint height prior to tibial cut.","Methodology":"The first consecutive case series included 216 CR TKA. Standing postoperative lateral view radiographs were utilized to measure the vertical distance between tibial tuberosity and tibial osteotomy plane. In the second case series, 223 knee MRIs were consecutively analyzed to measure the vertical distance between tibial tuberosity and PCL footprint.

{"Research Question":"Is the affinity column-mediated immunoassay method suitable as an alternative to the microparticle enzyme immunoassay method as a blood tacrolimus assay?","Introduction":"Tacrolimus is a potent immunosuppressive drug used in organ transplantation. Because of its substantial toxic effects, narrow therapeutic index, and interindividual pharmacokinetic variability, therapeutic drug monitoring of whole-blood tacrolimus concentrations has been recommended. We investigated the comparability of the results of 2 immunoassay systems, affinity column-mediated immunoassay (ACMIA) and microparticle enzyme immunoassay (MEIA), comparing differences in the tacrolimus concentrations measured by the 2 methods in relation to the hematologic and biochemical values of hepatic and renal functions.","Methodology":"A total of 154 samples from kidney or liver transplant recipients were subjected to Dimension RxL HM with a tacrolimus Flex reagent cartilage for the ACMIA method and IMx tacrolimus II for the MEIA method."}
{"Research Question":"Should tumor depth be included in prognostication of soft tissue sarcoma?","Introduction":"Most staging systems for soft tissue sarcoma are based on histologic malignancy-grade, tumor size and tumor depth. These factors are generally dichotomized, size at 5 cm. We believe it is unlikely that tumor depth per se should influence a tumor's metastatic capability. Therefore we hypothesized that the unfavourable prognostic importance of depth could be explained by the close association between size and depth, deep-seated tumors on average being larger than the superficial ones. When tumor size is dichotomized, this effect should be most pronounced in the large size (>5 cm) group in which the size span is larger.","Methodology":"We analyzed the associations between tumor size and depth and the prognostic importance of grade, size and depth in a population-based series of 490 adult patients with soft tissue sarcoma of the extremity or trunk wall with complete, 4.5 years minimum, follow-up."}
{"Research Question":"Is amoxapine an atypical antipsychotic?","Introduction":"All currently available atypical antipsychotics have, at clinically relevant doses: i) high serotonin (5-HT)2 occupancy; ii) greater 5-HT2 than dopamine (D)2 occupancy; and iii) a higher incidence of extrapyramidal side effects when their D2 occupancy exceeds 80%. A review of pharmacologic and behavioral data suggested that amoxapine should also conform to this profile; therefore, we undertook a positron-emission tomography (PET) study of its 5-HT2 and D2 occupancy.","Methodology":"Seven healthy volunteers received 50-250 mg\/day of amoxapine for 5 days and then had [11C]-raclopride and [18F]-setoperone PET scans."}

{"Research Question":"Does head positioning influence anterior chamber depth in pseudoexfoliation syndrome?","Introduction":"Phacodonesis can occur in pseudoexfoliation syndrome because of impaired zonular support. This study investigates whether the increased mobility of the lens influences anterior chamber depth in patients with pseudoexfoliation while assuming a prone position.","Methodology":"Central anterior chamber depth was measured in 39 patients with clinically apparent unilateral pseudoexfoliation and elevated intraocular pressure. Patients were placed in a face-up position for 5 minutes, at which time anterior chamber depth and axial length were measured by A scan, and intraocular pressure was measured by Tonopen (Oculab, La Jolla, CA) in both eyes. The measurements were repeated on both eyes after 5 minutes in a face-down position."}
{"Research Question":"Sternal plating for primary and secondary sternal closure; can it improve sternal stability?","Introduction":"Sternal instability with mediastinitis is a very serious complication after median sternotomy. Biomechanical studies have suggested superiority of rigid plate fixation over wire cerclage for sternal fixation. This study tests the hypothesis that sternal closure stability can be improved by adding plate fixation in a human cadaver model.","Methodology":"Midline sternotomy was performed in 18 human cadavers. Four sternal closure techniques were tested: (1) approximation with six interrupted steel wires; (2) approximation with six interrupted cables; (3) closure 1 (wires) or 2 (cables) reinforced with a transverse sternal plate at the sixth rib; (4) Closure using 4 sternal plates alone. Intrathoracic pressure was increased in all techniques while sternal separation was measured by three pairs of sonomicrometry crystals fixed at the upper, middle and lower parts of the sternum until 2.0 mm separation was detected. Differences in displacement pressures were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA and Regression Coefficients."}

{"Research Question":"Is the histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1 (HINT1) gene a candidate for schizophrenia?","Introduction":": The histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1, HINT1, hydrolyzes adenosine 5'-monophosphoramidate substrates such as AMP-morpholidate. The human HINT1 gene is located on chromosome 5q31.2, a region implicated in linkage studies of schizophrenia. HINT1 had been shown to have different expression in postmortem brains between schizophrenia patients and unaffected controls. It was also found to be associated with the dysregulation of postsynaptic dopamine transmission, thus suggesting a potential role in several neuropsychiatric diseases.","Methodology":": In this work, we studied 8 SNPs around the HINT1 gene region using the Irish study of high density schizophrenia families (ISHDSF, 1350 subjects and 273 pedigrees) and the Irish case control study of schizophrenia (ICCSS, 655 affected subjects and 626 controls). The expression level of HINT1 was compared between the postmortem brain cDNAs from schizophrenic patients and unaffected controls provided by the Stanley Medical Research Institute."}
{"Research Question":"Increased neutrophil migratory activity after major trauma: a factor in the etiology of acute respiratory distress syndrome?","Introduction":"Neutrophil infiltration of the lung is characteristic of early posttraumatic acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This study examines the ability of neutrophils isolated (over the first 24 hrs) from the peripheral blood of patients admitted after major trauma to migrate in response to interleukin-8. Interleukin-8 is elevated in the lung within 2 hrs of major trauma in patients who later develop ARDS, and thus it plays a central role in the recruitment of neutrophils to the lung and their subsequent activation. We hypothesized that enhanced interleukin-8-mediated neutrophil migratory activity in the early postinjury phase, before the development of ARDS, may be a crucial factor in the etiology of ARDS.","Methodology":"Prospective observational study."}
{"Research Question":"BCRABL transcript detection by quantitative real-time PCR : are correlated results possible from homebrew assays?","Introduction":"Quantitative real-time PCR has become the predominant molecular technique to monitor BCRABL levels in response to treatment in Ph(+) leukemia patients.

{"Research Question":"Does a febrile reaction to platelets predispose recipients to red blood cell alloimmunization?","Introduction":"A variable effect of inflammation on alloimmunization to transfused red blood cells (RBCs) in mice has been recently reported. We investigated whether RBC alloimmunization in humans was affected by transfusion of blood products in temporal proximity to experiencing a febrile transfusion reaction (FTR) to platelets (PLTs), an event predominantly mediated by inflammatory cytokines.","Methodology":"Blood bank databases were used to identify patients who experienced an FTR or possible FTR to PLTs from August 2000 to March 2008 (FTR group). The control group of patients received a PLT transfusion on randomly selected dates without experiencing an FTR. The \"event\" was defined as the PLT transfusion that caused the FTR in the FTR group or the index PLT transfusion in the control group. The number of transfused blood products and their proximity to the event were recorded along with other recipient data. The primary endpoint was the rate of RBC alloimmunization between the two groups."}
{"Research Question":"Maternal creatine homeostasis is altered during gestation in the spiny mouse: is this a metabolic adaptation to pregnancy?","Introduction":"Pregnancy induces adaptations in maternal metabolism to meet the increased need for nutrients by the placenta and fetus. Creatine is an important intracellular metabolite obtained from the diet and also synthesised endogenously. Experimental evidence suggests that the fetus relies on a maternal supply of creatine for much of gestation. However, the impact of pregnancy on maternal creatine homeostasis is unclear. We hypothesise that alteration of maternal creatine homeostasis occurs during pregnancy to ensure adequate levels of this essential substrate are available for maternal tissues, the placenta and fetus. This study aimed to describe maternal creatine homeostasis from mid to late gestation in the precocial spiny mouse.","Methodology":"Plasma creatine concentration and urinary excretion were measured from mid to late gestation in pregnant (n = 8) and age-matched virgin female spiny mice (n = 6). At term, body composition and organ weights were assessed and tissue total creatine content determined. mRNA expression of the creatine synthesising enzymes arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT) and guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT), and the creatine transporter (CrT1) were assessed by RT-qPCR. Protein expression of AGAT and GAMT was also assessed by western blot analysis."}

{"Research Question":"Is Alveolar Macrophage Phagocytic Dysfunction in Children With Protracted Bacterial Bronchitis a Forerunner to Bronchiectasis?","Introduction":"Children with recurrent protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) and bronchiectasis share common features, and PBB is likely a forerunner to bronchiectasis. Both diseases are associated with neutrophilic inflammation and frequent isolation of potentially pathogenic microorganisms, including nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi), from the lower airway. Defective alveolar macrophage phagocytosis of apoptotic bronchial epithelial cells (efferocytosis), as found in other chronic lung diseases, may also contribute to tissue damage and neutrophil persistence. Thus, in children with bronchiectasis or PBB and in control subjects, we quantified the phagocytosis of airway apoptotic cells and NTHi by alveolar macrophages and related the phagocytic capacity to clinical and airway inflammation.","Methodology":"Children with bronchiectasis (n = 55) or PBB (n = 13) and control subjects (n = 13) were recruited. Alveolar macrophage phagocytosis, efferocytosis, and expression of phagocytic scavenger receptors were assessed by flow cytometry. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid interleukin (IL) 1β was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay."}

{"Research Question":"A patient with myelomeningocele: is untethering necessary prior to scoliosis correction?","Introduction":"Tethering of the spinal cord is thought to increase the chance of neurological injury when scoliosis correction is undertaken. All patients with myelomeningocele (MM) are radiographically tethered, and untethering procedures carry significant morbidity risks including worsening neurological function and wound complications. No guidelines exist as regards untethering in patients with MM prior to scoliosis correction surgery. The authors' aim in this study was to evaluate their experience in patients with MM who were not untethered before scoliosis correction.","Methodology":"Seventeen patients with MM were retrospectively identified and 1) had no evidence of a clinically symptomatic tethered cord, 2) had undergone spinal fusion for scoliosis correction, and 3) had not been untethered for at least 1 year prior to surgery. The minimum follow-up after fusion was 2 years. Charts and radiographs were reviewed for neurological or shunt complications in the perioperative period."}
{"Research Question":"Is aerobic workload positively related to ambulatory blood pressure?","Introduction":"Cardiovascular disease is prevalent among workers with high levels of occupational physical activity. The increased risk may be due to a high relative aerobic workload, possibly leading to increased blood pressure. However, studies investigating the relation between relative aerobic workload and ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) are lacking. The aim was to explore the relationship between objectively measured relative aerobic workload and ABP.","Methodology":"A total of 116 cleaners aged 18-65 years were included after informed consent was obtained. A portable device (Spacelabs 90217) was mounted for 24-h measurements of ABP, and an Actiheart was mounted for 24-h heart rate measurements to calculate relative aerobic workload as percentage of relative heart rate reserve. A repeated-measure multi-adjusted mixed model was applied for analysis."}
{"Research Question":"Does the sequence of clamp application during open abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery influence distal embolisation?","Introduction":"Embolisation of atherosclerotic debris during abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair is responsible for significant peri-operative morbidity. Reports have suggested that preferential clamping of the distal vessel(s) before the proximal aorta may decrease the number of emboli passing distally and hence reduce complications.","Methodology":"Forty patients undergoing AAA repair were randomised to have either first clamping of the proximal aorta or the iliac vessels. Emboli passing through the Superficial Femoral Arteries were detected with a Transcranial Doppler ultrasound system."}
{"Research Question":"Are lower fasting plasma glucose levels at diagnosis of type 2 diabetes associated with improved outcomes?","Introduction":"Type 2 diabetes may be present for several years before diagnosis, by which time many patients have already developed diabetic complications. Earlier detection and treatment may reduce this burden, but evidence to support this approach is lacking.","Methodology":"Glycemic control and clinical and surrogate outcomes were compared for 5,088 of 5,102 U.K. Diabetes Prospective Study participants according to whether they had low (<140 mg\/dl [<7.8 mmol\/l]), intermediate (140 to<180 mg\/dl [7.8 to<10.0 mmol\/l]), or high (>or =180 mg\/dl [>or =10 mmol\/l]) fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels at diagnosis. Individuals who presented with and without diabetic symptoms were also compared."}
{"Research Question":"Do elderly patients call 911 when presented with clinical scenarios suggestive of acute stroke?","Introduction":"Among patients with acute stroke symptoms, delay in hospital admission is the main obstacle for the use of thrombolytic therapy and other interventions associated with decreased mortality and disability. The primary aim of this study was to assess whether an elderly clinical population correctly endorsed the response to call for emergency services when presented with signs and symptoms of stroke using a standardized questionnaire.","Methodology":"We performed a cross-sectional study among elderly out-patients (≥60 years) in Buenos Aires, Argentina randomly recruited from a government funded health clinic. The correct endorsement of intention to call 911 was assessed with the Stroke Action Test and the cut-off point was set at ≥75%. Knowledge of stroke and clinical and socio-demographic indicators were also collected and evaluated as predictors of correct endorsement using logistic regression."}
{"Research Question":"Are virtual planning and guided surgery for head and neck reconstruction economically viable?","Introduction":"Virtual planning and guided surgery with or without prebent or milled plates are becoming more and more common for mandibular reconstruction with fibular free flaps (FFFs). Although this excellent surgical option is being used more widely, the question of the additional cost of planning and cutting-guide production has to be discussed. In capped payment systems such additional costs have to be offset by other savings if there are no special provisions for extra funding. Our study was designed to determine whether using virtual planning and guided surgery resulted in time saved during surgery and whether this time gain resulted in self-funding of such planning through the time saved.","Methodology":"All consecutive cases of FFF surgery were evaluated during a 2-year period. Institutional data were used to determine the price of 1 minute of operative time. The time for fibula molding, plate adaptation, and insetting was recorded."}

Early discharge and traditional stay infants were compared to determine the percentage of newborns screened and the timing of the first adequate specimen."}
{"Research Question":"Are stroke patients' reports of home blood pressure readings reliable?","Introduction":"To assess the reliability of home BP recording in hypertensive patients who had suffered a recent stroke or transient ischaemic attack.\nHome blood pressure (BP) monitoring is gaining increasing popularity among patients and may be useful in hypertension management. Little is known about the reliability of stroke patients' records of home BP monitoring.","Methodology":"Thirty-nine stroke patients (mean age 73 years) randomized to the intervention arm of a trial of home BP monitoring were included. Following instruction by a research nurse, patients recorded their BPs at home and documented them in a booklet over the next year. The booklet readings over a month were compared with the actual readings downloaded from the BP monitor and were checked for errors or selective bias in recording."}
{"Research Question":"Does increasing blood pH stimulate protein synthesis in dialysis patients?","Introduction":"Although the mechanism of muscle wasting in end-stage renal disease is not fully understood, there is increasing evidence that acidosis induces muscle protein degradation and could therefore contribute to the loss of muscle protein stores of patients on hemodialysis, a prototypical state of chronic metabolic acidosis (CMA). Because body protein mass is controlled by the balance between synthesis and degradation, protein loss can occur as result of either increased breakdown, impaired synthesis, or both. Correction of acidosis may therefore help to maintain muscle mass and improve the health of patients with CMA. We evaluated whether alkalizing patients on hemodialysis might have a positive effect on protein synthesis and on nutritional parameters.","Methodology":"Eight chronic hemodialysis patients were treated daily with oral sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO(3)) supplementation for 10-14 days, yielding a pre-dialytic plasma bicarbonate concentration of 28.6 +\/-1.6 mmol\/l. The fractional synthesis rates (FSR) of muscle protein and albumin were obtained by the L-[(2)H(5)ring]phenylalanine flooding technique."}
{"Research Question":"Is there a relationship between homocysteine and vitiligo?","Introduction":"To determine the level of Hcy in the blood of patients with vitiligo as a first step in revealing if it has any relationship with the pathogenesis of vitiligo and consequently if this will have an impact on the treatment of vitiligo.\nPigmentary dilution is observed in patients with homocystinuria. Therefore, it is possible that an increase of local homocysteine (Hcy) interferes with normal melanogenesis and plays a role in the pathogenesis of vitiligo. Vitamin B12 and folic acid, levels of which are decreased in vitiligo, are important cofactors in the metabolism of Hcy. Consequently, a nutritional deficiency in either of these two vitamins will result in an increase in homocysteine in the circulation, a finding that we expect to find in vitiligo.","Methodology":"Twenty-six patients of both sexes with vitiligo (age range 20-50 years, mean 31.4 +\/- 8.09) and 26 age-matched healthy controls were included in the study. After excluding factors that may affect serum Hcy levels, blood samples from patients and controls were obtained for homocysteine determination by enzyme immunoassay."}
{"Research Question":"Do dermatomyositis and polymyositis affect similar thigh muscles?","Introduction":"Dermatomyositis (DM) and polymyositis (PM) commonly cause weakness of the thigh muscles. However, it is debated whether DM and PM affect similar thigh muscles. Muscle oedema on fat-suppressed MRI sequences is thought to represent active inflammation. In this study, we aimed to assess which thigh muscle groups are preferentially inflamed in DM and PM, respectively, using short-tau inversion-recovery MRI sequences.","Methodology":"We analysed 71 patients from 2 Rheumatology centres, 31 with DM and 40 with PM diagnosed according to the Bohan and Peter criteria. MRI oedema (1=present, 0=absent) was assessed bilaterally on fat-suppressed sequences in 17 pelvic floor and thigh muscles. An MRI oedema score (range 0-17) was calculated by adding the separate scores bilaterally and dividing them by two. Inter-rater variability was assessed by intraclass correlation coefficient. Fisher's exact test was used to compare binomial data."}
{"Research Question":"Is Aspiration Thrombectomy Beneficial in Patients Undergoing Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention?","Introduction":"It is unclear whether intravenous glycoprotein IIb\/IIIa inhibitors or ischemic time might modify any clinical benefits observed with aspiration thrombectomy before primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction.","Methodology":"Electronic databases were searched for trials that randomized ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction patients to aspiration thrombectomy before PCI versus conventional PCI. Summary estimates were constructed using a DerSimonian-Laird model. Seventeen trials with 20 960 patients were available for analysis. When compared with conventional PCI, aspiration thrombectomy was not associated with a significant reduction in the risk of mortality 2.8% versus 3.2% (risk ratio [RR], 0.89; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.76-1.04; P=0.13), reinfarction 1.3% versus 1.4% (RR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.73-1.17; P=0.52), the combined outcome of mortality or reinfarction 4.1% versus 4.6% (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.79-1.02; P=0.11), or stent thrombosis 0.9% versus 1.2% (RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.62-1.08; P=0.15). Aspiration thrombectomy was associated with a nonsignificant increase in the risk of stroke 0.6% versus 0.4% (RR, 1.45; 95% CI, 0.96-2.21; P=0.08). Meta-regression analysis did not identify a difference for the log RR of mortality, reinfarction, and the combined outcome of mortality or reinfarction with intravenous glycoprotein IIb\/IIIa inhibitors (P=0.17, 0.70, and 0.50, respectively) or with ischemic time (P=0.29, 0.66, and 0.58, respectively)."}

{"Research Question":"Is a pressor necessary during aortic perfusion and oxygenation therapy of cardiac arrest?","Introduction":"Occlusion of the descending aorta and infusion of oxygenated ultrapurified polymerized bovine hemoglobin may improve the efficacy of advanced cardiac life support (ACLS). Because selective aortic perfusion and oxygenation (SAPO) directly increases coronary perfusion pressure, exogenous epinephrine may not be required. The purpose of this study was to determine whether exogenous epinephrine is necessary during SAPO by comparing the rate of return of spontaneous circulation and aortic and coronary perfusion pressures during ACLS-SAPO in animals treated with either intra-aortic epinephrine or saline solution.","Methodology":"A prospective, randomized, interventional before-after trial with a canine model of ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest and ACLS based on external chest compression was performed. The ECG, right atrial, aortic arch, and esophageal pulse pressures were measured continuously. A descending aortic occlusion balloon catheter was placed through the femoral artery. Ventricular fibrillation was induced, and no therapy was given during the 10-minute arrest time. Basic life support was then initiated and normalized by standardization of esophageal pulse pressure and central aortic blood gases. After 3 minutes of basic life support, the aortic occlusion balloon was inflated, and 0.01 mg\/kg epinephrine or saline solution was administered through the aortic catheter followed by 450 mL of ultrapurified polymerized bovine hemoglobin over 2 minutes.

{"Research Question":"Motor performance in chronic low back pain: is there an influence of pain-related cognitions?","Introduction":"Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is often accompanied by an abnormal motor performance. However, it has not been clarified yet whether these deviations also occur during motor tasks not involving the back and whether the performance is influenced by pain and pain-related cognitions. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to get insight in the contribution of both pain experience and pain-related cognitions to general motor task performance in CLBP.","Methodology":"13 CLBP patients and 15 healthy subjects performed a hand-function task in three conditions: sitting, lying prone (lying) and lying prone without trunk support (provoking). The last condition was assumed to provoke pain-related cognitions, which was considered successful when a patients' pain expectancy on a numeric rating scale was at least 1 point higher than actual pain experienced. Subjects' performance was expressed in reaction time and movement time. Repeated measures analysis of variance was performed to detect main effect for group and condition. Special interest was given to group*condition interaction, since significant interaction would indicate that patients and healthy subjects performed differently throughout the three conditions."}

{"Research Question":"Is withdrawal-induced anxiety in alcoholism based on beta-endorphin deficiency?","Introduction":"Associations between several psychopathological alterations and lowered beta-endorphin(beta E) plasma levels have already been stated in former studies. However, whereas single measures during static conditions generally failed in linking beta E levels with psychopathology, dynamic changes of beta E in particular have been shown to be associated with spells of anxiety and depression. During alcohol withdrawal, a decreased secretion of beta E with a delayed normalization has been reported, but up to now only few data became available regarding the interaction of plasma beta E and psychopathological parameters. The aim of our study was to test the hypothesis whether beta E during acute alcohol withdrawal is associated with anxiety, depression, and craving.","Methodology":"We observed self-rated anxiety, depression, and craving during alcohol withdrawal and assessed beta E levels (RIA) in a consecutive sample of 60 alcoholics on day 1 and day 14 after onset of withdrawal, and in 30 healthy volunteers. To control for mutual interactions of beta E and the pituitary-adrenocortical hormone secretion, plasma corticotropin (ACTH) and cortisol were also determined."}

{"Research Question":"Are income-related differences in active travel associated with physical environmental characteristics?","Introduction":"Rates of active travel vary by socio-economic position, with higher rates generally observed among less affluent populations. Aspects of both social and built environments have been shown to affect active travel, but little research has explored the influence of physical environmental characteristics, and less has examined whether physical environment affects socio-economic inequality in active travel. This study explored income-related differences in active travel in relation to multiple physical environmental characteristics including air pollution, climate and levels of green space, in urban areas across England. We hypothesised that any gradient in the relationship between income and active travel would be least pronounced in the least physically environmentally-deprived areas where higher income populations may be more likely to choose active transport as a means of travel.","Methodology":"Adults aged 16+ living in urban areas (n = 20,146) were selected from the 2002 and 2003 waves of the UK National Travel Survey. The mode of all short non-recreational trips undertaken by the sample was identified (n = 205,673). Three-level binary logistic regression models were used to explore how associations between the trip being active (by bike\/walking) and three income groups, varied by level of multiple physical environmental deprivation."}
{"Research Question":"Is routine intraoperative frozen-section examination of sentinel lymph nodes in breast cancer worthwhile?","Introduction":"Routine intraoperative frozen section (FS) of sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) can detect metastatic disease, allowing immediate axillary dissection and avoiding the need for reoperation. Routine FS is also costly, increases operative time, and is subject to false-negative results. We examined the benefit of routine intraoperative FS among the first 1000 patients at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center who had SLN biopsy for breast cancer.","Methodology":"We performed SLN biopsy with intraoperative FS in 890 consecutive breast cancer patients, none of whom had a back-up axillary dissection planned in advance. Serial sections and immunohistochemical staining for cytokeratins were performed on all SLN that proved negative on FS. The sensitivity of FS was determined as a function of (1) tumor size and (2) volume of metastatic disease in the SLN, and the benefit of FS was defined as the avoidance of a reoperative axillary dissection."}

{"Research Question":"Do mossy fibers release GABA?","Introduction":"Mossy fibers are the sole excitatory projection from dentate gyrus granule cells to the hippocampus, forming part of the trisynaptic hippocampal circuit. They undergo significant plasticity during epileptogenesis and have been implicated in seizure generation. Mossy fibers are a highly unusual projection in the mammalian brain; in addition to glutamate, they release adenosine, dynorphin, zinc, and possibly other peptides. Mossy fiber terminals also show intense immunoreactivity for the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and immunoreactivity for GAD67. The purpose of this review is to present physiologic evidence of GABA release by mossy fibers and its modulation by epileptic activity.","Methodology":"We used hippocampal slices from 3- to 5-week-old guinea pigs and made whole-cell voltage clamp recordings from CA3 pyramidal cells. We placed stimulating electrodes in stratum granulosum and adjusted their position in order to recruit mossy fiber to CA3 projections."}
{"Research Question":"Can Ambu self-inflating bag and Neopuff infant resuscitator provide adequate and safe manual inflations for infants up to 10 kg weight?","Introduction":"Manual resuscitation devices for infants and newborns must be able to provide adequate ventilation in a safe and consistent manner across a wide range of patient sizes (0.5-10 kg) and differing clinical states. There are little comparative data assessing biomechanical performance of common infant manual resuscitation devices across the manufacturers' recommended operating weight ranges. We aimed to compare performance of the Ambu self-inflating bag (SIB) with the Neopuff T-piece resuscitator in three resuscitation models.","Methodology":"Five experienced clinicians delivered targeted ventilation to three lung models differing in compliance, delivery pressures and inflation rates; Preterm (0.5 mL\/cmH2O, 25\/5 cmH2O, 60 per minute), Term (3 mL\/cmH2O, 30\/5 cmH2O, 40 per minute) and Infant (9 mL\/cmH2O, 35\/5 cmH2O, 30 per minute). The Neopuff was examined with three gas inflow rates (5 litres per minute (LPM), 10 LPM and 15 LPM) and the Ambu with no gas inflow."}
{"Research Question":"Is resected stomach volume related to weight loss after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy?","Introduction":"Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) was initially performed as the first stage of biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch for the treatment of super-obese or high-risk obese patients but is now most commonly performed as a standalone operation. The aim of this prospective study was to investigate outcomes after LSG according to resected stomach volume.","Methodology":"Between May 2011 and April 2013, LSG was performed in 102 consecutive patients undergoing bariatric surgery. Two patients were excluded, and data from the remaining 100 patients were analyzed in this study. Patients were divided into three groups according to the following resected stomach volume: 700-1,200 mL (group A, n = 21), 1,200-1,700 mL (group B, n = 62), and>1,700 mL (group C, n = 17). Mean values were compared among the groups by analysis of variance."}
{"Research Question":"Do ART patients face higher C-section rates during their stage of delivery?","Introduction":"The mode of delivery depends on multiple parameters. After assisted reproductive technology (ART), previous studies have shown elevated C-section rates but few studies differentiated between elective and emergency operations and different protocols of cryopreservation. Because these studies did not use multiparity as exclusion criteria which reduces confounding with previous pregnancies, aim of this study is to compare mode of delivery of different techniques of ART using data of primiparae only [1, 2].","Methodology":"Retrospective analysis of patient data treated at the university hospital of Luebeck in a period of 12 years. Patients were divided in different groups according to their way of conception: spontaneous conception and conception after ART. The group of ART was further divided into: (a) a group of fresh transferred embryos (IVF\/ICSI), (b) vitrification and (c) slow freezing. Exclusion criteria were defined as: multiparity, delivery<24. + 0 p.m., incomplete data and treatment outside university of Luebeck. Main parameter of this study was mode of delivery which was divided into spontaneous delivery or C-section. C-sections were further differentiated into elective or emergency C-sections."}
{"Research Question":"Does a preoperative medically supervised weight loss program improve bariatric surgery outcomes?","Introduction":"Many insurance payors mandate that bariatric surgery candidates undergo a medically supervised weight management (MSWM) program as a prerequisite for surgery. However, there is little evidence to support this requirement. We evaluated in a randomized controlled trial the hypothesis that participation in a MSWM program does not predict outcomes after laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) in a publicly insured population.","Methodology":"This pilot randomized trial was conducted in a large academic urban public hospital. Patients who met NIH consensus criteria for bariatric surgery and whose insurance did not require a mandatory 6-month MSWM program were randomized to a MSWM program with monthly visits over 6 months (individual or group) or usual care for 6 months and then followed for bariatric surgery outcomes postoperatively. Demographics, weight, and patient behavior scores, including patient adherence, eating behavior, patient activation, and physical activity, were collected at baseline and at 6 months (immediately preoperatively and postoperatively)."}

{"Research Question":"SPECT study with I-123-Ioflupane (DaTSCAN) in patients with essential tremor. Is there any correlation with Parkinson's disease?","Introduction":"The differential diagnosis between essential tremor (ET) and Parkinson's disease (PD) may be, in some cases, very difficult on clinical grounds alone. In addition, it is accepted that a small percentage of ET patients presenting symptoms and signs of possible PD may progress finally to a typical pattern of parkinsonism. Ioflupane, N-u-fluoropropyl-2a-carbomethoxy-3a-(4-iodophenyl) nortropane, also called FP-CIT, labelled with (123)I (commercially known as DaTSCAN) has been proven to be useful in the differential diagnosis between PD and ET and to confirm dopaminergic degeneration in patients with parkinsonism. The aim of this study is to identify dopaminergic degeneration in patients with PD and distinguish them from others with ET using semi-quantitative SPECT (123)I-Ioflupane (DaTSCAN) data in comparison with normal volunteers (NV), in addition with the respective ones of patients referred as suffering from ET, as well as, of patients with a PD diagnosis at an initial stage with a unilateral presentation of motor signs.","Methodology":"Twenty-eight patients suffering from ET (10 males plus 18 females) and 28 NV (12 males and 16 females) were enroled in this study. In addition, 33 patients (11 males and 22 females) with an established diagnosis of PD with unilateral limb involvement (12 left hemi-body and 21 right hemi-body) were included for comparison with ET. We used DaTSCAN to obtain SPECT images and measure the radiopharmaceutical uptake in the striatum (S), as well as the caudate nucleus (CN) and putamen (P) in all individuals."}

{"Research Question":"Outcomes of severely injured adult trauma patients in an Australian health service: does trauma center level make a difference?","Introduction":"Trauma centers are designated to provide systematized multidisciplinary care to injured patients. Effective trauma systems reduce patient mortality by facilitating the treatment of injured patients at appropriately resourced hospitals. Several U.S. studies report reduced mortality among patients admitted directly to a level I trauma center compared with those admitted to hospitals with less resources. It has yet to be shown whether there is an outcome benefit associated with the \"level of hospital\" initially treating severely injured trauma patients in Australia. This study was designed to determine whether the level of trauma center providing treatment impacts mortality and\/or hospital length of stay.","Methodology":"Outcomes were evaluated for severely injured trauma patients with an Injury Severity Score (ISS)>15 using NSW Institute of Trauma and Injury Management data from 2002-2007 for our regional health service. To assess the association between trauma centers and binary outcomes, a logistic regression model was used. To assess the association between trauma centers and continuous outcomes, a multivariable linear regression model was used. Sex, age, and ISS were included as covariates in all models."}

{"Research Question":"Do oblique views add value in the diagnosis of spondylolysis in adolescents?","Introduction":"Anteroposterior, lateral, and right and left oblique lumbar spine radiographs are often a standard part of the evaluation of children who are clinically suspected of having spondylolysis. Recent concerns regarding radiation exposure and costs have brought the value of oblique radiographs into question. The purpose of the present study was to determine the diagnostic value of oblique views in the diagnosis of spondylolysis.","Methodology":"Radiographs of fifty adolescents with L5 spondylolysis without spondylolisthesis and fifty controls were retrospectively reviewed. All controls were confirmed not to have spondylolysis on the basis of computed tomographic scanning, magnetic resonance imaging, or bone scanning. Anteroposterior, lateral, and right and left oblique radiographs of the lumbar spine were arranged into two sets of slides: one showing four views (anteroposterior, lateral, right oblique, and left oblique) and one showing two views (anteroposterior and lateral only). The slides were randomly presented to four pediatric spine surgeons for diagnosis, with four-view slides being presented first, followed by two-view slides. The slides for twenty random patients were later reanalyzed in order to calculate of intra-rater agreement. A power analysis demonstrated that this study was adequately powered. Inter-rater and intra-rater agreement were assessed on the basis of the percentage of overall agreement and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). PCXMC software was used to generate effective radiation doses. Study charges were determined from radiology billing data."}
{"Research Question":"Does gestational age misclassification explain the difference in birthweights for Australian aborigines and whites?","Introduction":"After 34 weeks gestation, summary measures of location for birthweight (e.g means and centiles) increase more slowly for Australian Aborigines than for whites. A similar pattern has been observed for blacks in the US. This study tests whether the reported pattern is due to differential misclassification of gestational age.","Methodology":"Simulation was used to measure the potential effect of differential misclassification of gestational age. Reported gestational age data were obtained from Queensland Perinatal Data Collection (QPDC). Estimates of the true distributions of gestational age were obtained by assuming various (plausible) types of misclassification and applying these to the reported distributions. Previous studies and data from the QPDC were used to help specify the birthweight distributions used in the simulations."}
{"Research Question":"Is there any interest to perform ultrasonography in boys with undescended testis?","Introduction":"To evaluate the accuracy of ultrasonographic examination in boys with an undescended testis.","Methodology":"All patients who were referred to the paediatric surgeon after detection of an undescended testis were evaluated prospectively between November 2001 and November 2004. Among these 377 patients, 87 were referred with an ultrasonogram previously prescribed by the referring primary physician. The results of the ultrasonogram were compared to the results of the clinical examination of the paediatric surgeon and, in cases of no palpable testis, to the surgical findings."}
{"Research Question":"Is peak concentration needed in therapeutic drug monitoring of vancomycin?","Introduction":"We analyzed the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship of vancomycin to determine the drug exposure parameters that correlate with the efficacy and nephrotoxicity of vancomycin in patients with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia and evaluated the need to use peak concentration in therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM).","Methodology":"Serum drug concentrations of 31 hospitalized patients treated with vancomycin for methicillin-resistant S. aureus pneumonia were collected."}
{"Research Question":"Are sugars-free medicines more erosive than sugars-containing medicines?","Introduction":"The reduced use of sugars-containing (SC) liquid medicines has increased the use of other dose forms, potentially resulting in more widespread dental effects, including tooth wear. The aim of this study was to assess the erosive potential of 97 paediatric medicines in vitro.","Methodology":"The study took the form of in vitro measurement of endogenous pH and titratable acidity (mmol). Endogenous pH was measured using a pH meter, followed by titration to pH 7.0 with 0.1-M NaOH."}
