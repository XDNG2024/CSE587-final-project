Is CA72-4 a useful biomarker in differential diagnosis between ovarian endometrioma and epithelial ovarian cancer?,Surgical excision of ovarian endometriomas in patients desiring pregnancy has recently been criticized because of the risk of damage to healthy ovarian tissue and consequent reduction of ovarian reserve. A correct diagnosis in cases not scheduled for surgery is therefore mandatory in order to avoid unexpected ovarian cancer misdiagnosis. Endometriosis is often associated with high levels of CA125. This marker is therefore not useful for discriminating ovarian endometrioma from ovarian malignancy. The aim of this study was to establish if the serum marker CA72-4 could be helpful in the differential diagnosis between ovarian endometriosis and epithelial ovarian cancer.,Serums CA125 and CA72-4 were measured in 72 patients with ovarian endometriomas and 55 patients with ovarian cancer.,"Introduction: Surgical excision of ovarian endometriomas in patients desiring pregnancy has recently been criticized because of the risk of damage to healthy ovarian tissue and consequent reduction of ovarian reserve.

To determine if plate clearing is a risk factor for obesity.

Methodology:
Plate clearing is a term used to describe the phenomenon of platelet aggregation, which is thought to be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Platelet aggregation is thought to be a result of platelet activation, which is mediated by a series of steps including the activation of platelets by the release of platelet-bound adenosine diphosphate (ADP), the binding of ADP to the platelet surface, and the subsequent activation of platelets by the release of ADP and the binding of ADP to the platelet surface.

The relationship between plate clearing and obesity is a complex one, and research has shown mixed results. Plate clearing, a common eating habit characterized by eating a large meal in one sitting, has been linked to various health issues, including obesity. However, the relationship between plate clearing and obesity is not yet fully understood, and more research is needed to determine if it is a risk factor for obesity.

Methodology:
To conduct this research, a quantitative study would be conducted. A sample of adults (n = 100) would be selected from a larger population, and participants would be asked to keep a food diary for 6 weeks. During this time, participants would be instructed to eat a large meal in one sitting (plate clearing) and a standard portion of their daily food intake (non-clearing). Weight and height measurements would be taken at the beginning and end of the study, as well as at regular intervals during the 6-week period. The relationship between plate clearing and weight change would be analyzed using regression analysis, controlling for other factors such as age, sex, and physical activity level.",To determine if plate clearing is a risk factor for obesity.,"Plate clearing is a term used to describe the phenomenon of platelet aggregation, which is thought to be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.
