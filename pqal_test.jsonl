{"Research Question":"Is CA72-4 a useful biomarker in differential diagnosis between ovarian endometrioma and epithelial ovarian cancer?","Introduction":"Surgical excision of ovarian endometriomas in patients desiring pregnancy has recently been criticized because of the risk of damage to healthy ovarian tissue and consequent reduction of ovarian reserve. A correct diagnosis in cases not scheduled for surgery is therefore mandatory in order to avoid unexpected ovarian cancer misdiagnosis. Endometriosis is often associated with high levels of CA125. This marker is therefore not useful for discriminating ovarian endometrioma from ovarian malignancy. The aim of this study was to establish if the serum marker CA72-4 could be helpful in the differential diagnosis between ovarian endometriosis and epithelial ovarian cancer.","Methodology":"Serums CA125 and CA72-4 were measured in 72 patients with ovarian endometriomas and 55 patients with ovarian cancer."}
{"Research Question":"Transgastric endoscopic splenectomy: is it possible?","Introduction":"We have previously reported the feasibility of diagnostic and therapeutic peritoneoscopy including liver biopsy, gastrojejunostomy, and tubal ligation by an oral transgastric approach. We present results of per-oral transgastric splenectomy in a porcine model. The goal of this study was to determine the technical feasibility of per-oral transgastric splenectomy using a flexible endoscope.","Methodology":"We performed acute experiments on 50-kg pigs. All animals were fed liquids for 3 days prior to procedure. The procedures were performed under general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation. The flexible endoscope was passed per orally into the stomach and puncture of the gastric wall was performed with a needle knife. The puncture was extended to create a 1.5-cm incision using a pull-type sphincterotome, and a double-channel endoscope was advanced into the peritoneal cavity. The peritoneal cavity was insufflated with air through the endoscope. The spleen was visualized. The splenic vessels were ligated with endoscopic loops and clips, and then mesentery was dissected using electrocautery."}
{"Research Question":"Is routine chest radiography after transbronchial biopsy necessary?","Introduction":"Pneumothorax following flexible bronchoscopy (FB) with transbronchial biopsy (TBB) occurs in 1 to 6% of cases. Routine chest radiography (CXR) following TBB is therefore requested by most pulmonologists in an attempt to detect complications, particularly pneumothorax. The objective of this study was to determine if routine CXR after bronchoscopy and TBB is necessary.","Methodology":"The study group included 350 consecutive patients who underwent FB with TBB at our institution between December 2001 and January 2004. Routine CXR was performed up to 2 h after the procedure in all cases.

{"Research Question":"Can EMS Providers Provide Appropriate Tidal Volumes in a Simulated Adult-sized Patient with a Pediatric-sized Bag-Valve-Mask?","Introduction":"In the prehospital setting, Emergency Medical Services (EMS) professionals rely on providing positive pressure ventilation with a bag-valve-mask (BVM). Multiple emergency medicine and critical care studies have shown that lung-protective ventilation protocols reduce morbidity and mortality. Our primary objective was to determine if a group of EMS professionals could provide ventilations with a smaller BVM that would be sufficient to ventilate patients. Secondary objectives included 1) if the pediatric bag provided volumes similar to lung-protective ventilation in the hospital setting and 2) compare volumes provided to the patient depending on the type of airway (mask, King tube, and intubation).","Methodology":"Using a patient simulator of a head and thorax that was able to record respiratory rate, tidal volume, peak pressure, and minute volume via a laptop computer, participants were asked to ventilate the simulator during six 1-minute ventilation tests. The first scenario was BVM ventilation with an oropharyngeal airway in place ventilating with both an adult- and pediatric-sized BVM, the second scenario had a supraglottic airway and both bags, and the third scenario had an endotracheal tube and both bags. Participants were enrolled in convenience manner while they were on-duty and the research staff was able to travel to their stations. Prior to enrolling, participants were not given any additional training on ventilation skills."}
{"Research Question":"Does case-mix based reimbursement stimulate the development of process-oriented care delivery?","Introduction":"Reimbursement based on the total care of a patient during an acute episode of illness is believed to stimulate management and clinicians to reduce quality problems like waiting times and poor coordination of care delivery. Although many studies already show that this kind of case-mix based reimbursement leads to more efficiency, it remains unclear whether care coordination improved as well. This study aims to explore whether case-mix based reimbursement stimulates development of care coordination by the use of care programmes, and a process-oriented way of working.","Methodology":"Data for this study were gathered during the winter of 2007\/2008 in a survey involving all Dutch hospitals. Descriptive and structural equation modelling (SEM) analyses were conducted."}

{"Research Question":"Production of chemokines by perivascular adipose tissue: a role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis?","Introduction":"Obesity is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease. Although it is known that white adipose tissue (WAT) produces numerous proinflammatory and proatherogenic cytokines and chemokines, it is unclear whether adipose-derived chemotactic signals affect the chronic inflammation in atherosclerosis.","Methodology":"Histological examination showed that perivascular WAT (pWAT) is in close proximity to vascular walls, particularly at sites that have a tendency to develop atherosclerosis. In rodents, the amount of pWAT is markedly increased by a high-fat diet. At a functional level, supernatant from subcutaneous and pWAT strongly induced the chemotaxis of peripheral blood leukocytes. The migration of granulocytes and monocytes was mostly mediated by interleukin-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, respectively, whereas both chemokines contributed to the migration of activated T cells. Moreover, pWAT produces these chemokines, as shown by immunohistochemistry and by explant culture. The accumulation of macrophages and T cells at the interface between pWAT and the adventitia of human atherosclerotic aortas may reflect this prochemotactic activity of pWAT."}
{"Research Question":"Does reducing spasticity translate into functional benefit?","Introduction":"Spasticity and loss of function in an affected arm are common after stroke.

{"Research Question":"Do inhaled corticosteroids affect perception of dyspnea during bronchoconstriction in asthma?","Introduction":"We hypothesized that if the inflammation of the airway wall influences to some extent and in some way the PD in asthma patients, ICSs reverse the effect of airway inflammation on the PD.\nSome of the disagreements on the perception of dyspnea (PD) during bronchoconstriction in asthma patients could depend on the interrelationships among the following: (1) the influence of baseline airflow obstruction on the patient's ability to detect any further increase in airway resistance; (2) the effect of eosinophilic inflammation on the airway; (3) bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR); and (4) the effect of inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs).","Methodology":"We studied 100 asthma patients who were divided into the following four groups: patients with obstruction who were either ICS-naive (group I) or were treated with ICSs (group II); and nonobstructed patients who were either ICS-naive (group III) or were treated with ICSs (group IV). PD on the visual analog scale (VAS) was assessed during a methacholine-induced FEV(1) decrease and specifically was quantified as the VAS slope and score at an FEV(1) decrease of 5 to 20%. BHR was assessed in terms of the provocative concentration of methacholine causing a 20% fall in FEV(1) (PC(20)). Eosinophil counts in induced sputum samples also were performed. Regression analysis, univariate analysis of variance, and factor analysis were applied for statistical evaluation."}
{"Research Question":"Impact of MPH programs: contributing to health system strengthening in low- and middle-income countries?","Introduction":"The \"health workforce\" crisis has led to an increased interest in health professional education, including MPH programs. Recently, it was questioned whether training of mid- to higher level cadres in public health prepared graduates with competencies to strengthen health systems in low- and middle-income countries. Measuring educational impact has been notoriously difficult; therefore, innovative methods for measuring the outcome and impact of MPH programs were sought. Impact was conceptualized as \"impact on workplace\" and \"impact on society,\" which entailed studying how these competencies were enacted and to what effect within the context of the graduates' workplaces, as well as on societal health.","Methodology":"This is part of a larger six-country mixed method study; in this paper, the focus is on the qualitative findings of two English language programs, one a distance MPH program offered from South Africa, the other a residential program in the Netherlands.

Univariate logistic regression analysis was followed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve construction for the indices that were significant."}
{"Research Question":"Patient comprehension of emergency department care and instructions: are patients aware of when they do not understand?","Introduction":"To be able to adhere to discharge instructions after a visit to the emergency department (ED), patients should understand both the care that they received and their discharge instructions. The objective of this study is to assess, at discharge, patients' comprehension of their ED care and instructions and their awareness of deficiencies in their comprehension.","Methodology":"We conducted structured interviews of 140 adult English-speaking patients or their primary caregivers after ED discharge in 2 health systems. Participants rated their subjective understanding of 4 domains: (1) diagnosis and cause; (2) ED care; (3) post-ED care, and (4) return instructions. We assessed patient comprehension as the degree of agreement (concordance) between patients' recall of each of these domains and information obtained from chart review. Two authors scored each case independently and discussed discrepancies before providing a final concordance rating (no concordance, minimal concordance, partial concordance, near concordance, complete concordance)."}
{"Research Question":"Do episodic migraineurs selectively attend to headache-related visual stimuli?","Introduction":"To assess pain-related attentional biases among individuals with episodic migraine.\nPrior studies have examined whether chronic pain patients selectively attend to pain-related stimuli in the environment, but these studies have produced largely mixed findings and focused primarily on patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain. Limited research has implicated attentional biases among chronic headache patients, but no studies have been conducted among episodic migraineurs, who comprise the overwhelming majority of the migraine population.","Methodology":"This was a case-control, experimental study. Three hundred and eight participants (mean age = 19.2 years [standard deviation = 3.3]; 69.5% female; 36.4% minority), consisting of 84 episodic migraineurs, diagnosed in accordance with International Classification of Headache Disorders (2(nd) edition) criteria using a structured diagnostic interview, and 224 non-migraine controls completed a computerized dot probe task to assess attentional bias toward headache-related pictorial stimuli.

{"Research Question":"Does responsibility affect the public's valuation of health care interventions?","Introduction":"Health services often spend more on safety interventions than seems cost-effective. This study investigates whether the public value safety-related health care improvements more highly than the same improvements in contexts where the health care system is not responsible.","Methodology":"An online survey was conducted to elicit the relative importance placed on preventing harms caused by 1) health care (hospital-acquired infections, drug administration errors, injuries to health care staff), 2) individuals (personal lifestyle choices, sports-related injuries), and 3) nature (genetic disorders). Direct valuations were obtained from members of the public by using a person trade-off or \"matching\" method. Participants were asked to choose between two preventative interventions of equal cost and equal health benefit per person for the same number of people, but differing in causation. If participants indicated a preference, their strength of preference was measured by using person trade-off."}
{"Research Question":"Does diabetes mellitus influence the efficacy of FDG-PET in the diagnosis of cervical cancer?","Introduction":"Compared with computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET) may have additional value in the assessment of primary and recurrent cervical cancer. However, the degree of tumour uptake of (18)F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D: -glucose (FDG) uptake is sometimes influenced by diabetes mellitus (DM). Therefore, we conducted this prospective study to compare the diagnostic ability of FDG-PET in patients with cervical cancer complicated by DM and those without DM.","Methodology":"Patients with untreated locally advanced primary or clinically curable recurrent cervical carcinoma were enrolled. Both FDG-PET and MRI\/CT scans were performed within 2 weeks. Patients were categorised into the following groups: hyperglycaemic DM (fasting blood sugar>126 mg\/dl), euglycaemic DM and non-DM. The lesions were confirmed histologically or by clinical follow-up.

{"Research Question":"Is (18)F-FDG a surrogate tracer to measure tumor hypoxia?","Introduction":"Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) has been reported as a surrogate tracer to measure tumor hypoxia with positron emission tomography (PET). The hypothesis is that there is an increased uptake of FDG under hypoxic conditions secondary to enhanced glycolysis, compensating the hypoxia-induced loss of cellular energy production. Several studies have already addressed this issue, some with conflicting results. This study aimed to compare the tracers (14)C-EF3 and (18)F-FDG to detect hypoxia in mouse tumor models.","Methodology":"C3H, tumor-bearing mice (FSAII and SCCVII tumors) were injected iv with (14)C-EF3, and 1h later with (18)F-FDG. Using a specifically designed immobilization device with fiducial markers, PET (Mosaic®, Philips) images were acquired 1h after the FDG injection. After imaging, the device containing mouse was frozen, transversally sliced and imaged with autoradiography (AR) (FLA-5100, Fujifilm) to obtain high resolution images of the (18)F-FDG distribution within the tumor area. After a 48-h delay allowing for (18)F decay a second AR was performed to image (14)C-EF3 distribution. AR images were aligned to reconstruct the full 3D tumor volume, and were compared with the PET images. Image segmentation with threshold-based methods was applied on both AR and PET images to derive various tracer activity volumes. The matching index DSI (dice similarity index) was then computed. The comparison was performed under normoxic (ambient air"}

{"Research Question":"Diagnosis and follow-up in constipated children: should we use ultrasound?","Introduction":"We investigated the efficacy of ultrasound in determining megarectum and fecal load and the response to treatment in constipation and tried to specify objective criteria in this study.","Methodology":"A total of 66 cases were queried and divided into 2 groups as constipated (n = 35; mean age, 6.8 ± 2.9 years) and control (n = 31; mean age, 8.4 ± 3.8 years) according to Rome III criteria. After the clinical evaluation, pelvic ultrasonography (US) was performed by 2 separate radiologists. The bladder capacity and the transverse rectal diameter were measured with a full bladder. Then the rectal diameter and rectal anterior wall thickness were measured, and the presence of fecal load in the rectum and sigmoid colon was recorded with an empty bladder. The examination and ultrasound were repeated after treatment for a month in these patients."}
{"Research Question":"Is the Hawkins sign able to predict necrosis in fractures of the neck of the astragalus?","Introduction":"To assess if the Hawkins sign can predict whether or not astragalus fractures of the neck will develop avascular necrosis. It is also assessed whether the occurrence of this complication is related to the displacement of the fracture, soft tissue injury, or delay in the reduction or surgery. The results were compared with those found in the literature.","Methodology":"A retrospective study was conducted on 23 talar neck fractures recorded over a a period of thirteen years. The following variables were analysed: displacement of the fracture, soft tissue injury, delay and type of treatment, complications, observation of the Hawkins sign, and functional outcome."}
{"Research Question":"Can you deliver accurate tidal volume by manual resuscitator?","Introduction":"One of the problems with manual resuscitators is the difficulty in achieving accurate volume delivery. The volume delivered to the patient varies by the physical characteristics of the person and method. This study was designed to compare tidal volumes delivered by the squeezing method, physical characteristics and education and practice levels.","Methodology":"114 individuals trained in basic life support and bag-valve-mask ventilation participated in this study. Individual characteristics were obtained by the observer and the education and practice level were described by the subjects. Ventilation was delivered with a manual resuscitator connected to a microspirometer and volumes were measured. Subjects completed three procedures: one-handed, two-handed and two-handed half-compression."}
{"Research Question":"Do emergency ultrasound fellowship programs impact emergency medicine residents' ultrasound education?","Introduction":"Recent years have seen a rapid proliferation of emergency ultrasound (EUS) programs in the United States. To date, there is no evidence supporting that EUS fellowships enhance residents' ultrasound (US) educational experiences. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of EUS fellowships on emergency medicine (EM) residents' US education.","Methodology":"We conducted a cross-sectional study at 9 academic medical centers. A questionnaire on US education and bedside US use was pilot tested and given to EM residents. The primary outcomes included the number of US examinations performed, scope of bedside US applications, barriers to residents' US education, and US use in the emergency department. The secondary outcomes were factors that would impact residents' US education. The outcomes were compared between residency programs with and without EUS fellowships."}

The amount of assistance provided was compared with professional fee schedules for general\/routine eye examinations and market prices for eyeglasses. The utilization of eye care providers was derived from the CCHS."}
{"Research Question":"Can communication with terminally ill patients be taught?","Introduction":"Communication with terminally ill patients is a main responsibility of physicians. However, many physicians feel insufficiently prepared for this task. Models of courses resulting in improvements of communicative skills of participants have been published mainly in the Anglo-American literature. This study describes the realization of a 2-day course model based on the experiences of the first three courses of this kind in Rhineland-Palatinate, and analyzes changes of participants' communication behavior.","Methodology":"After each seminary, an evaluation form concerning participants' satisfaction with the course was filled in. Furthermore, all course participants received a questionnaire at the beginning and at the end of the course, as well as 3 months afterwards. The participants were asked to assess their own sense of security in seven different communication settings on a visual analog scale, and to specify perceived changes in their communication behavior 3 months after the course."}
{"Research Question":"Is there an increase in the incidence of gbs carrier rates among pregnant women in northern Israel?","Introduction":"Group B Streptococci (GBS) asymptomatically colonize the vaginal or rectal areas of about 20% of pregnant women (4-40%). About 50% of infants to mothers with GBS colonization also become colonized at rectal, umbilical or oral sites. GBS is a leading bacterial cause of neonatal illness and death. The present prevalence rate of GBS carriers among parturients in the western Galilee in Israel is unknown.AIM: A prospective study of the GBS carrier rate according to origin and gestational age in the western Galilee in Israel.","Methodology":"A prospective study including 700 pregnant women. All women were screened for carriage of GBS by vaginal and rectal cultures."}
{"Research Question":"Can clinical supervision sustain our workforce in the current healthcare landscape?","Introduction":"Clinical supervision is widely recognised as a mechanism for providing professional support, professional development and clinical governance for healthcare workers. There have been limited studies about the effectiveness of clinical supervision for allied health and minimal studies conducted within the Australian health context. The aim of the present study was to identify whether clinical supervision was perceived to be effective by allied health professionals and to identify components that contributed to effectiveness. Participants completed an anonymous online questionnaire, administered through the health service's intranet.","Methodology":"A cross-sectional study was conducted with community allied health workers (n = 82) 8 months after implementation of structured clinical supervision. Demographic data (age, gender), work-related history (profession employment level, years of experience), and supervision practice (number and length of supervision sessions) were collected through an online survey. The outcome measure, clinical supervision effectiveness, was operationalised using the Manchester Clinical Supervision Scale-26 (MCSS-26). Data were analysed with Pearson correlation (r) and independent sample t-tests (t) with significance set at 0.05 (ie the probability of significant difference set at P<0.05)."}
{"Research Question":"Is there a need for pelvic CT scan in cases of renal cell carcinoma?","Introduction":"To determine the necessity of pelvic computed tomography (CT) in patients of renal cell carcinoma (RCC).","Methodology":"We reviewed the records of 400 patients of RCC, who underwent treatment at our institution between January 1988 and February 2001. These patients were evaluated pre-operatively with ultrasonograms (USG) and contrast enhanced CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis. USG or CT scans of these cases were reviewed for presence of pathology in the pelvis, which were classified into 3 categories viz; benign and likely to be insignificant, benign and likely to be significant; and malignant."}
{"Research Question":"Does combining antiretroviral agents in a single dosage form enhance quality of life of HIV\/AIDS patients?","Introduction":"This is a cost-utility study from a health care system's perspective comparing coformulated fixed dose (FXD) strategy versus multiple free dose combination (FRC) in antiretroviral therapy.\nCombining various antiretroviral agents into one single dosage form has been a strategy to reduce pill burden and enhance medication adherence among human immunodeficiency virus \/AIDS (HIV\/AIDS) patients.","Methodology":"The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) was used to identify HIV\/AIDS patients with ≥2 active antiretroviral medications. Patients on FXD were matched in 1:1 ratio with the FRC group using propensity scores. All medical costs excluding those paid by patients and families were included. Utility was measured using SF-6D scores from the SF-12 questionnaire. Incremental cost-utility ratios (ICURs) were calculated using the mean annual estimates. A cost-effectiveness acceptability curve was determined using a Monte Carlo probabilistic simulation technique."}

{"Research Question":"Do symptoms matter when considering patients for phase I clinical trials?","Introduction":"Older adults (OA) with advanced cancer (AC) undergoing phase I clinical trials (PICT) have poor prognosis. There are no studies which describe symptoms experienced by OA.","Methodology":"Retrospective chart review of PICT participants>60 years. OA were compared by age (>65 vs 60-65) and by number of symptoms (>3 vs ≤3)."}
{"Research Question":"Do general practice characteristics influence uptake of an information technology (IT) innovation in primary care?","Introduction":"Recent evaluations of IT innovations in primary care have highlighted variations between centres and practices in uptake and use. We evaluated whether structural characteristics of a general practice were associated with variations in use of a web-based clinical information system underpinning a Managed Clinical Network in diabetes, between the years 2001 and 2003.","Methodology":"Using a computerised audit trail, we calculated the numbers of web-based operations that occurred in each practice, stratified by staff type and year, and adjusted for the numbers of registered diabetic patients. In regression analyses, we determined whether total use was associated with structural characteristics of the practice (total list size, training status, numbers of GPs (general practitioners), mean age of the GPs, numbers of female GPs, level of deprivation of the population and whether staff had received advanced training in diabetes care)."}
{"Research Question":"Major depression and alcohol use disorder in adolescence: Does comorbidity lead to poorer outcomes of depression?","Introduction":"Comorbid major depression (MD) and alcohol use disorder (AUD), particularly in adolescents, have been shown to be associated with poorer subsequent MD outcomes.","Methodology":"Longitudinal data were used to model associations between a four-level classification of MD\/AUD during the period 15-18 years (neither; MD-only; AUD-only; comorbid MD\/AUD) and MD over the period 18-35 years. These associations were then adjusted for confounding by a series of factors measured in childhood."}
{"Research Question":"Laminoplasty outcomes: is there a difference between patients with degenerative stenosis and those with ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament?","Introduction":"Two common causes of cervical myelopathy include degenerative stenosis and ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL). It has been postulated that patients with OPLL have more complications and worse outcomes than those with degenerative stenosis. The authors sought to compare the surgical results of laminoplasty in the treatment of cervical stenosis with myelopathy due to either degenerative changes or segmental OPLL.","Methodology":"The authors conducted a retrospective review of 40 instrumented laminoplasty cases performed at a single institution over a 4-year period to treat cervical myelopathy without kyphosis. Twelve of these patients had degenerative cervical stenotic myelopathy ([CSM]; degenerative group), and the remaining 28 had segmental OPLL (OPLL group). The 2 groups had statistically similar demographic characteristics and number of treated levels (mean 3.9 surgically treated levels; p>0.05). The authors collected perioperative and follow-up data, including radiographic results."}
{"Research Question":"Is the covering of the resection margin after distal pancreatectomy advantageous?","Introduction":"In recent years, many advances in pancreatic surgery have been achieved. Nevertheless, the rate of pancreatic fistula following pancreatic tail resection does not differ between various techniques, still reaching up to 30% in prospective multicentric studies. Taking into account contradictory results concerning the usefulness of covering resection margins after distal pancreatectomy, we sought to perform a systematic, retrospective analysis of patients that underwent distal pancreatectomy at our center.","Methodology":"We retrospectively analysed the data of 74 patients that underwent distal pancreatectomy between 2001 and 2011 at the community hospital in Neuss. Demographic factors, indications, postoperative complications, surgical or interventional revisions, and length of hospital stay were registered to compare the outcome of patients undergoing distal pancreatectomy with coverage of the resection margins vs. patients undergoing distal pancreatectomy without coverage of the resection margins. Differences between groups were calculated using Fisher's exact and Mann-Whitney U test."}
