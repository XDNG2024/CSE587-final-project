"Introduction:\nTo determine if transgastric endoscopic splenectomy is possible.\n\nMethodology:\nTransgastric endoscopic splenectomy is a procedure that uses an endoscope to access and remove the spleen. This procedure is generally used for splenomegaly, which is the enlargement of the spleen. The procedure involves making a small incision in the abdomen and using an endoscope to access and remove the spleen. This procedure is typically performed by a surgeon who has experience with splenectomy. The purpose of this study was to determine if transgastric endoscopic splenectomy is possible for patients with splenomegaly."
"Introduction:\nThe purpose of this study was to determine whether routine chest radiography is necessary after transbronchial biopsy.\n\nMethodology: Transbronchial biopsy (TB) was performed on 30 patients with lung cancer. Routine chest radiography was performed in all 30 patients. The results were compared with those of patients without TB. The patients were divided into two groups: patients with TB and patients without TB. Routine chest radiography was performed on patients with TB, and chest radiography was not performed on patients without TB. The results were compared with those of patients without TB.\n\nResearch Question: Is routine chest radiography after transbronchial biopsy necessary?"
"Introduction:\nThe question of whether intrauterine cocaine exposure (ICGE) affects delinquency during early adolescence is an important one, as it relates to the potential for drug use to influence behavior that is critical during adolescence. The goal of this study was to investigate the relationship between ICGE and delinquency during early adolescence.\n\nMethodology:\nA retrospective review of the ICGE records of 21,500 children who were born to mothers who were enrolled in the Longitudinal Study of Child Health and Environment (LSCHE). The records included information on the ICGE status of each child, the age of the child at the time of the ICGE, and the child's age at the time of the ICGE. The ICGE status was defined as a positive ICGE (i.e., a positive ICGE was defined as a child whose mother had been administered ICGE during pregnancy). The child's age at the time of the ICGE was defined as the age of the child at the time of the ICGE.

"Introduction:\nTo determine whether an EMS provider could provide an appropriate tidal volume in a simulated adult-sized patient with a pediatric-sized bag-valve-mask (BVM).\n\nMethodology:\nThe research involved simulating a scenario where an EMS provider would be transporting a pediatric-sized BVM. The EMS provider was asked to determine the appropriate tidal volume based on the patient's weight and respiratory rate. The patient's weight and respiratory rate were measured during the simulation. The EMS provider's response was recorded and compared to the guidelines for pediatric BVMs. The simulation was repeated with the patient's weight and respiratory rate adjusted to a pediatric size. The EMS provider's response was recorded and compared to the guidelines for pediatric BVMs."
"Introduction:\nThe case-mix model is widely used to analyze healthcare utilization patterns. Process-oriented care delivery refers to the design of a healthcare organization's care delivery system. The case-mix model is based on the idea that healthcare organizations should be comparable in terms of case mix and should be able to provide care to a comparable number of patients. Process-oriented care delivery refers to the design of a healthcare organization's care delivery system that focuses on the process of care delivery rather than the case mix of patients.\n\nMethodology: This study applied the case-mix model to the case-mix of patients who were treated by a hospital in a metropolitan area. The study used a case-mix model to identify patients who were treated by the same hospital and compared the case mix of patients treated by the same hospital with patients treated by other hospitals in the same metropolitan area. The study used the process-oriented care delivery model to identify patients who were treated by hospitals that had process-oriented care delivery systems."
"Introduction:\nThe aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of chemoradiation as an alternative to surgery in the treatment of mid and low rectal tumors.\n\nMethodology: This study is a retrospective analysis of 20 patients with mid and low rectal tumors who were treated with chemoradiation (n=20) and 4 patients with mid and low rectal tumors who were treated with surgery (n=4). All patients received a total of 30 cycles of chemotherapy (n=20) and 2 cycles of radiation therapy (n=4). Patients were evaluated for toxicity, quality of life, and survival.

"Introduction:\nTo determine if plate clearing is a risk factor for obesity.\n\nMethodology:\nPlate clearing is a term used to describe the phenomenon of platelet aggregation, which is thought to be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Platelet aggregation is thought to be a result of platelet activation, which is mediated by a series of steps including the activation of platelets by the release of platelet-bound adenosine diphosphate (ADP), the binding of ADP to the platelet surface, and the subsequent activation of platelets by the release of ADP and the binding of ADP to the platelet surface. Platelet aggregation is thought to be a result of the activation of platelets by a series of steps involving the binding of ADP to the platelet surface. Platelet aggregation is thought to be a result of the activation of platelets by a series of steps involving the binding of ADP to the platelet surface.

"Introduction:\nResearch Question: This study aimed to investigate the relationship between blood pressure (BP) measurement by a physician and a nurse in patients with treated hypertension. The hypothesis was that the method of measurement would influence the observed relationship between BP and changes in BP.\n\nMethodology: A prospective, randomized, single-blinded, 2-week study was conducted in a university hospital. 100 hypertensive patients were randomly assigned to be either treated by a physician (n = 55) or a nurse (n = 45). The study was conducted in a hospital setting. Blood pressure was measured at the beginning of the study and again 1 week later. The relationship between BP and changes in BP was calculated for each patient and for the total group.\n\nThe results showed that there was no significant difference in the relationship between BP and changes in BP between the treated and untreated groups. For the total group, 5.3% of the variation in BP was due to the method of measurement. This was significant (p < 0.05). For the treated group, 5.3% of the variation in BP was due to the method of measurement, while for the untreated group, only 1.2% of the variation in BP was due to the method of measurement."
