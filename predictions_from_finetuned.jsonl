"Introduction:\nThe preoperative locoregional staging of gastric cancer is a critical step in determining the appropriate treatment strategy for patients with this disease. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has been increasingly recognized as a valuable tool in this process due to its high sensitivity and specificity for detecting tumor recurrence and metastasis. This study aims to evaluate the role of MRI in preoperative locoregional staging of gastric cancer.\n\nMethodology:\nThis study will involve a retrospective review of 100 consecutive patients with gastric cancer who underwent preoperative MRI before undergoing surgery. The MRI scans will be analyzed using standard imaging protocols, and the location of the tumor, lymph nodes, and metastasis will be assessed. The accuracy of the MRI-based staging will be compared to the traditional preoperative staging methods, including CT scans and clinical examination. The results will be used to determine whether MRI plays a place in the preoperative locoregional staging of gastric cancer."
